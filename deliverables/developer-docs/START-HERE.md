# P2 Developer Documentation - Start Here

Welcome to the P2 Knowledge Base developer documentation. This guide helps you quickly get productive with the Propeller 2 (P2) microcontroller.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### What is P2?
The Propeller 2 is a unique 8-core microcontroller designed for real-time, parallel processing applications. Each core (called a "cog") runs independently at 180MHz+, sharing access to 512KB of hub RAM and 64 Smart Pins.

### Why P2?
- **True Parallelism**: 8 independent processors, no interrupts needed
- **Smart Pins**: Hardware-accelerated I/O for any protocol
- **Deterministic Timing**: Predictable, jitter-free operation
- **CORDIC Solver**: Hardware math acceleration for DSP/graphics

## üìö Learning Paths
