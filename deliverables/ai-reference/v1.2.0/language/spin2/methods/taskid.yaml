  Get the current task's ID
category: Task Operations
syntax: "id := TASKID()"
parameters: []
returns:
  type: "integer"
  description: "Current task ID (0-31)"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Get current task ID
      my_id := TASKID()
      debug("Running as task ", udec(my_id))
    description: "Display current task ID"
  - code: |
      ' Task-specific behavior
      case TASKID()
        0: main_task_work()
        1: worker1_work()
        2: worker2_work()
    description: "Task-specific execution"
  - code: |
      ' Store task ID for later
      VAR
        LONG task_ids[32]
      
      task_ids[TASKID()] := GETCT()  ' Store start time

notes:
  - "Returns ID of currently executing task"
  - "Main task is typically ID 0"
  - "Useful for task-specific storage/behavior"
  - "Each task has unique ID 0-31"
  - "ID remains constant for task lifetime"
