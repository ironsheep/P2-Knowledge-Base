type: method
description: |
  Read smart pin result without clearing IN flag
category: Smart Pin Operations
syntax: "result := RQPIN(PinField)"
parameters:
  - name: "PinField"
    type: "pin_field"
    description: "Pin number (0-63) or pin field expression"
returns:
  type: "long"
  description: "32-bit result with bit 31 containing the pin's C flag state"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Peek at smart pin value without acknowledging
      current_count := RQPIN(24)
    description: "Read current value without affecting measurement"
  - code: |
      ' Monitor ADC without clearing ready flag
      if PINREAD(16)  ' Check if new data ready
        preview := RQPIN(16)  ' Preview value
        if preview > threshold
          actual := RDPIN(16)  ' Now acknowledge
    description: "Preview value before deciding to acknowledge"
  - code: |
      ' Check multiple pins without acknowledging
      repeat pin from 8 to 15
        values[pin] := RQPIN(pin)

notes:
  - "Does NOT clear the smart pin's IN flag"
  - "Bit 31 contains the pin's C flag state"
  - "Lower 31 bits contain the smart pin measurement/result"
  - "Useful for peeking at current value without affecting operation"
  - "Pin continues to assert IN flag after RQPIN"
  - "Use RDPIN to read and acknowledge"
  - "Smart pin must be configured with WRPIN/WXPIN/WYPIN first"
