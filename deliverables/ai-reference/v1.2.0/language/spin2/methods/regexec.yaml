method: REGEXEC
type: method
description: |
  Load and execute PASM2 code from hub RAM
category: Miscellaneous
syntax: "result := REGEXEC(HubAddress)"
parameters:
  - name: "HubAddress"
    type: "address"
    description: "Hub address of PASM2 code to load and execute"
returns:
  type: "long"
  description: "Value returned in result1 register"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Execute PASM from hub
      result := REGEXEC(@hub_pasm_code)
      
      DAT
      hub_pasm_code
        ' PASM code here
        mov result1, #123
        ret
    description: "Execute hub-based PASM code"
  - code: |
      ' Dynamic code execution
      build_pasm_code(@buffer)  ' Generate code
      result := REGEXEC(@buffer)  ' Execute it
    description: "Execute dynamically generated code"
  - code: |
      ' Large PASM routine
      result := REGEXEC(@big_routine)
      
      DAT
      big_routine
        ' Can be > 512 longs
        ' Loaded and executed in chunks
    description: "Execute large PASM routine"
notes:
  - "Loads PASM from hub to cog then executes"
  - "Can execute code larger than cog RAM"
  - "Preserves Spin2 interpreter"
  - "Result in result1 register"
  - "PASM must end with RET"
  - "Parameters via PTRA/PTRB"
  - "More flexible than CALL"
