type: method
description: |
  Load PASM2 code from hub to cog registers
category: Miscellaneous
syntax: "REGLOAD(HubAddress)"
parameters:
  - name: "HubAddress"
    type: "address"
    description: "Hub address of PASM2 code to load"
returns:
  type: "void"
  description: "No return value"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Load PASM code
      REGLOAD(@pasm_routines)
      ' Code now in cog, ready to CALL
    description: "Load PASM for later execution"
  - code: |
      ' Update PASM code
      modify_pasm(@buffer)  ' Modify code
      REGLOAD(@buffer)      ' Reload it
      result := CALL($100)  ' Execute at cog address
    description: "Dynamic code modification"
  - code: |
      ' Load different routines
      if mode == 1
        REGLOAD(@fast_routines)
      else
        REGLOAD(@accurate_routines)

notes:
  - "Loads code but doesn't execute"
  - "Use CALL to execute after loading"
  - "Overwrites cog registers"
  - "Preserves Spin2 interpreter area"
  - "Maximum 496 longs can be loaded"
  - "Useful for swapping PASM routines"
timing:
