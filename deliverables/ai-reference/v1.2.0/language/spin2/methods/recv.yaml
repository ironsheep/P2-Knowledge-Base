type: method
description: |
  Receive data byte using configured input method
category: Miscellaneous
syntax: "byte := RECV()"
parameters: []
returns:
  type: "byte"
  description: "Received byte value (0-255)"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Receive single byte
      char := RECV()
    description: "Receive one byte"
  - code: |
      ' Build string from input
      repeat i from 0 to 79
        buffer[i] := RECV()
        if buffer[i] == 13  ' Enter key
          buffer[i] := 0
          quit
    description: "Receive string until Enter"
  - code: |
      ' Echo received data
      repeat
        byte_in := RECV()
        SEND(byte_in)
    description: "Echo loop"
  - code: |
      ' Wait for specific character
      repeat until RECV() == "!"
      ' Got start character
    description: "Wait for start marker"
notes:
  - "Input method must be configured first"
  - "Typically used with serial drivers"
  - "Blocking operation - waits for byte"
  - "Returns single byte (0-255)"
  - "Works with user-defined input methods"
  - "Common for user input and data reception"
timing:
  description: "Depends on input method"
  cycles: "Variable - blocks until data available"
