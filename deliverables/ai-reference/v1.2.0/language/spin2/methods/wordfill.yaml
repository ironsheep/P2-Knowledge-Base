type: method
description: |
  Fill memory with a repeated word value
category: Memory Operations
syntax: "WORDFILL(DestAddress, Value, Count)"
parameters:
  - name: "DestAddress"
    type: "address"
    description: "Hub RAM starting address to begin filling"
  - name: "Value"
    type: "word"
    description: "16-bit word value to fill with"
  - name: "Count"
    type: "integer"
    description: "Number of words to fill"
returns:
  type: "void"
  description: "No return value"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Clear a word array to zero
      WORDFILL(@buffer, 0, 256)
    description: "Clear 256 words to zero"
  - code: |
      ' Initialize array with pattern
      WORDFILL(@data, $FFFF, 100)
    description: "Fill 100 words with $FFFF"
  - code: |
      ' Set default values
      WORDFILL(@settings, $1234, 50)
    description: "Initialize settings array with default value"
notes:
  - "Fills memory efficiently using hub operations"
  - "Each word is 2 bytes (16 bits)"
  - "Address should be word-aligned for best performance"
  - "Count of 0 fills no memory"
  - "Only lower 16 bits of Value are used"
timing:
