method: LONGSWAP
type: method
description: |
  Swap long values between two memory locations
category: Memory Operations
syntax: "LONGSWAP(Address1, Address2)"
parameters:
  - name: "Address1"
    type: "address"
    description: "First hub RAM address containing long to swap"
  - name: "Address2"
    type: "address"
    description: "Second hub RAM address containing long to swap"
returns:
  type: "void"
  description: "No return value"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Swap two long values
      LONGSWAP(@value1, @value2)
    description: "Exchange long values between variables"
  - code: |
      ' Reverse long order in array
      repeat i from 0 to size/2-1
        LONGSWAP(@array[i], @array[size-1-i])
    description: "Reverse array using long swapping"
  - code: |
      ' Swap register values
      LONGSWAP(@reg_a, @reg_b)
    description: "Exchange 32-bit register values"
notes:
  - "Atomically exchanges the 32-bit long values"
  - "Both addresses must be long-aligned (addresses divisible by 4)"
  - "No temporary variable needed for swap"
  - "Efficient single-operation exchange"
  - "Each long is 4 bytes"
