description: |
  Get length of null-terminated string
category: String Operations
syntax: "length := STRSIZE(StringAddress)"
parameters:
  - name: "StringAddress"
    type: "address"
    description: "Address of null-terminated string"
returns:
  type: "integer"
  description: "Number of characters (not including null terminator)"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Get string length
      len := STRSIZE(@message)
      debug("Message length: ", udec(len))
    description: "Get string length"
  - code: |
      ' Check if string fits in buffer
      if STRSIZE(@input) < buffer_size
        STRCOPY(@buffer, @input, buffer_size)
    description: "Validate before copying"
  - code: |
      ' Calculate total message size
      total := STRSIZE(@part1) + STRSIZE(@part2) + 1
    description: "Calculate combined length"
notes:
  - "Returns character count, not byte count"
  - "Does not include null terminator in count"
  - "Stops counting at first null (0) byte"
  - "Returns 0 for empty string (immediate null)"
  - "No maximum length limit"
  - "Useful for buffer allocation"
