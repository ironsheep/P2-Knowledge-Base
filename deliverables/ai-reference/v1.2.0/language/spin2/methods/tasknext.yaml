examples:
  - code: |
      ' Cooperative yield
      repeat
        do_work_chunk()
        TASKNEXT()  ' Let other tasks run
    description: "Yield after work chunk"
  - code: |
      ' Polling with yield
      repeat
        if data_ready
          process_data()
        TASKNEXT()  ' Don't hog CPU
    description: "Polling with cooperation"
  - code: |
      ' Long computation with yields
      repeat i from 0 to 1000
        calculate_step(i)
        if i // 10 == 0
          TASKNEXT()  ' Yield every 10 iterations
