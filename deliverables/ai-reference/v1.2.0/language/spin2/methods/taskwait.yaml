type: method
description: |
  Wait for specific condition with task yielding
category: Task Operations
syntax: "TASKWAIT(Condition)"
parameters:
  - name: "Condition"
    type: "expression"
    description: "Boolean condition to wait for"
returns:
  type: "void"
  description: "No return value"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Wait for flag
      TASKWAIT(ready_flag == TRUE)
      ' Flag is now true
    description: "Wait for flag to be set"
  - code: |
      ' Wait for buffer space
      TASKWAIT(buffer_count < MAX_SIZE)
      ' Can now add to buffer
    description: "Wait for buffer availability"
  - code: |
      ' Wait for multiple conditions
      TASKWAIT(data_ready AND not busy_flag)
      ' Both conditions met
    description: "Wait for complex condition"
notes:
  - "Yields to other tasks while waiting"
  - "More efficient than busy waiting"
  - "Condition checked between yields"
  - "Returns when condition becomes true"
  - "Prevents CPU hogging during waits"
  - "Part of cooperative multitasking"
timing:
