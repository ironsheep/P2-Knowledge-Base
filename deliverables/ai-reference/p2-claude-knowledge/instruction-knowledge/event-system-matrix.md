# Event System Matrix

**Purpose**: Documents P2 event generation, handling, and coordination patterns.

## Event Sources and Handlers

### Event Generation Instructions
```pasm2
SETRE   source, event_id    ' Set/enable event source
SETRE1  source, event_id    ' Set event source (variant)
SETRE2  source, event_id    ' Set event source (variant)
SETRE3  source, event_id    ' Set event source (variant)
```

### Event Handling Instructions
```pasm2
WAITE   event_mask          ' Wait for any specified events
WAITES  event_mask          ' Wait for all specified events  
POLL    event_mask          ' Check events without waiting
CLRE    event_mask          ' Clear specified events
```

### Event Coordination Patterns
```pasm2
' Pattern: Wait for multiple event types
WAITE   #EVENT_TIMER | #EVENT_SMARTPIN
' Pattern: Conditional event handling  
POLL    #EVENT_MASK WZ
IF_NZ   JMP #handle_event
```

## Event Source Categories

### Timer Events
- **CNT-based timers**: System counter overflow events
- **Smart Pin timers**: Pin-based timing events
- **Interrupt timers**: Periodic interrupt generation

### I/O Events  
- **Smart Pin events**: Pin state change notifications
- **Serial events**: UART receive/transmit completion
- **ADC events**: Conversion completion notifications

### Inter-COG Events
- **Mailbox events**: COG-to-COG communication
- **Shared memory events**: Memory access coordination
- **Synchronization events**: Multi-COG coordination points
