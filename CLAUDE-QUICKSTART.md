## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Session Management for Performance

**üî• Clear conversation every 3-4 hours or 15-20 major file operations!**

Performance degrades as context accumulates. Watch for these warning signs:
- Responses getting slower
- Claude forgetting recent work
- Repetitive questions about already-discussed topics

### Session Health Indicators
- ‚úÖ **Healthy (0-3 hours)**: Fast responses, perfect recall
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning (3-4 hours)**: Slightly slower, may need reminders
- ‚ùå **Clear Now (4+ hours)**: Degraded performance, confusion

## üöÄ Essential Templates (Copy These!)

### 1. Session Starter
```
I need help with P2 (Propeller 2) development. You should have the P2 Knowledge Base 
repository information in CLAUDE.md.

Please access the P2 Knowledge Base directly from GitHub:
https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-Knowledge-Base

Start by reading the root manifest for navigation:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ironsheep/P2-Knowledge-Base/main/manifests/p2-knowledge-root.yaml

My specific task is: [YOUR TASK HERE]
```

### 2. PASM2 Assembly Code
```
Using the P2 knowledge base PASM2 instructions in 
engineering/knowledge-base/P2/language/pasm2/, 
help me write assembly code to [DESCRIBE TASK].

Check manifests/pasm2-manifest.yaml for instruction categories.
```

### 3. Smart Pin Configuration
```
I need to configure a P2 Smart Pin for [PURPOSE].
Check engineering/knowledge-base/P2/hardware/smart-pins/modes/
and help me select and configure the right mode.
```

### 4. Community Code Discovery
```
Find me a P2 [TYPE] driver from the community.
Check manifests/obex-community-manifest.yaml and category manifests
for proven implementations with download URLs.
```

### 5. Session Resume (After Clearing)
```
Continuing P2 development session. Previous summary:
