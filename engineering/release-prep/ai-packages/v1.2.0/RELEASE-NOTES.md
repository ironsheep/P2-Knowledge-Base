# P2 Knowledge Base v1.2.0 Release Notes

**Released:** September 13, 2025

## Overview

Version 1.2.0 represents a significant enhancement to the P2 Knowledge Base with deep compiler integration and comprehensive PASM2 instruction documentation.

## Key Achievements

### PNUT_TS Compiler Integration
- Integrated PNUT_TS v1.51.5 compiler data for enhanced accuracy
- 39 unique operand format patterns with detailed compiler encoding
- Operand alternatives properly documented (e.g., `#S | D` for immediate OR register)
- Raw encoding values and bit patterns for all instructions

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **377 PASM2 files**: 360 instructions + 17 concept files
- **Documentation level**: Upgraded to "comprehensive" across instruction set
- **Real-world validation**: All examples validated with pnut_ts compiler
- **Enhanced metadata**: Source lineage, compiler compatibility, timing information

### Technical Improvements
- Operand format categorization (no operands vs. register operations vs. immediate values)
- Flag effects with detailed bit patterns (WC: `01`, WZ: `10`, WCZ: `11`)
- Cross-references between related instructions
- Schema validation for all YAML content

## Package Contents

### AI Reference Bundle
Complete knowledge optimized for AI code generation systems with manifests, schemas, and structured instruction definitions.

### Knowledge Core Bundle  
Full knowledge base including all YAML sources, concepts, and examples for advanced development tools.

### Learning Resources Bundle
Human-readable documentation, tutorials, and quick reference materials.

## Compatibility

- **PNUT_TS**: v1.51.5 and later
- **Schema**: Version 2.1
- **Format**: YAML with JSON manifests
- **Validation**: All content compiler-tested

## Quality Assurance

- Schema compliance verified across all files
- Compiler validation with pnut_ts
- Cross-reference integrity maintained
- No coverage regression from previous versions
