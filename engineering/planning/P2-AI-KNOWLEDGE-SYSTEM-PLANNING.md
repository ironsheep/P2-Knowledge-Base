# P2 AI Knowledge System Planning

## Vision
Enable AI agents (like Claude Code) to effectively pair with P2 developers by providing efficient, contextual access to authoritative P2 knowledge.

## Two-System Architecture

### System 1: Central Knowledge Base (What We're Building)
**Purpose**: Authoritative, comprehensive P2 reference
**Current State**: 76% coverage, systematic ingestion process established
**Target Users**: Knowledge maintainers, documentation generators, comprehensive queries

### System 2: Download-on-Demand System (To Be Designed)
**Purpose**: Efficient, contextual knowledge delivery to AI agents
**Target Users**: AI coding assistants working with P2 developers
**Key Requirement**: Minimize context window usage while maximizing relevance

## Key Planning Questions

### 1. Knowledge Base Architecture Questions
- What is the optimal structure for AI consumption vs human reference?
- How do we maintain single source of truth while supporting multiple output formats?
- What metadata is needed for efficient knowledge retrieval?
- How do we handle versioning (P2 silicon revisions, documentation updates)?

### 2. Download-on-Demand System Questions
- What are the access patterns when an AI helps with P2 development?
- How do we chunk knowledge for optimal context window usage?
- What indexing/search capabilities are needed?
- How do we prioritize what gets downloaded based on developer's task?

### 3. Integration Questions
- How does an AI agent discover what knowledge is available?
- What's the query interface (REST API, GraphQL, static hosting)?
- How do we handle knowledge dependencies (e.g., ADDX needs ADD context)?
- What caching strategies make sense?

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Help me write a Smart Pin UART"
AI needs:
- Smart Pin mode documentation (just UART mode)
- WRPIN/WXPIN/WYPIN instructions
- Basic P2 architecture (minimal)
- Example code snippets

### Scenario 2: "Debug this CORDIC calculation"
AI needs:
- CORDIC instruction set
- Pipeline timing details
- Common pitfalls/bugs
- Mathematical operation descriptions

### Scenario 3: "Optimize this data transfer routine"
AI needs:
- FIFO operations
- Hub timing windows
- Block transfer instructions (SETQ)
- Performance considerations

## Design Considerations

### For Central Knowledge Base
1. **Granularity**: How fine-grained should knowledge chunks be?
2. **Cross-references**: How to maintain relationships between concepts?
3. **Authority levels**: How to convey confidence/source authority?
4. **Examples**: Where to store, how to validate?

### For Download-on-Demand
1. **Query efficiency**: Natural language vs structured queries?
2. **Response size**: How much context is "just enough"?
3. **Incremental loading**: Can we progressively enhance knowledge?
4. **Offline capability**: Should some core knowledge be pre-cached?

## Technical Architecture Options

### Option 1: Static Site + CDN
- Pre-generate all knowledge chunks
- Use CDN for global distribution
- Simple URL-based access
- Version via URL paths

### Option 2: API-Based Service
- Dynamic knowledge assembly
- Query-based retrieval
- Usage analytics possible
- More complex to maintain

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Static core knowledge
- API for specialized queries
- Best of both worlds
- Progressive enhancement

## Success Metrics

### For Knowledge Base
- Coverage percentage (target: 95%+)
- Accuracy (validated against silicon)
- Completeness (no critical gaps)
- Maintainability (easy updates)

### For Download System
- Query response time (<100ms)
- Context efficiency (knowledge/tokens ratio)
- Task success rate (AI gives correct P2 code)
- Developer satisfaction

## Next Steps

1. **Define Knowledge Taxonomy**: What are the atomic units of P2 knowledge?
2. **Design Query Language**: How do AI agents request specific knowledge?
3. **Create Prototype**: Build minimal viable system with core instructions
4. **Test with Real Tasks**: Validate with actual P2 development scenarios
5. **Iterate Based on Usage**: Refine based on AI agent access patterns

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. Should instruction knowledge include inline examples or reference external example repository?
2. How do we handle knowledge that requires visual elements (timing diagrams, pin layouts)?
3. What's the update mechanism when new P2 information becomes available?
4. How do we support different AI models with varying context windows?
5. Should the system be P2-specific or generalizable to other microcontrollers?
