# Central Repository: Master Source vs Production Engine

## The Fundamental Question

**What IS the central repository?**

### Option A: THE Master Source
"This becomes the single source of truth. We edit here. Everything else is generated from this."

### Option B: Production Engine
"This is a transformation layer. Source documents remain the truth. This just reshapes them for consumption."

### Option C: Hybrid Reality
"This is both - it starts as production engine but evolves into master source as it matures."

## Let's Think Through This Practically

### The Current Reality
```
We have: 30+ source documents
         Multiple extraction narratives  
         Cross-source analysis
         Validation matrices
         
Problem: To answer "How does ADD work?" we check 5 places
```

### The Desired Future
```
We want: One query → Complete answer
         Confidence in the answer
         Ability to generate any format
         Efficient AI consumption
```

## The Shape That Makes Sense

### Start Simple: Key-Value Store of Atomic Facts

```python
# The simplest possible shape
p2_knowledge = {
    "instructions": {
        "ADD": {
            "syntax": "ADD D,{#}S {WC/WZ/WCZ}",
            "encoding": "EEEE 0001000 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS",
            "description": "Add S into D. D = D + S",
            "timing": {"cog": 2, "hub": 2},
            "flags": {
                "C": "carry of (D + S)",
                "Z": "result == 0"
            },
            "sources": ["CSV:10", "Silicon:45", "Chip:2025-09-02"],
            "confidence": 1.0,
            "examples": ["ADD x, #5", "ADD sum, value WC"],
            "related": ["ADDS", "ADDX", "ADDSX"],
            "patterns": ["Use in extended precision with ADDX"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Why This Shape Works

1. **It's Queryable**: `knowledge["instructions"]["ADD"]` - done
2. **It's Complete**: Everything about ADD in one place
3. **It's Validatable**: We can check for required fields
4. **It's Transformable**: Can generate any output format
5. **It's Maintainable**: Update one place

## The Practical Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Build the Aggregator (2-3 days)
```python
# Pseudo-code for the aggregator
def build_central_repository():
    repo = {}
    
    # Read all our sources
    csv_data = parse_csv("p2-instructions.csv")
    silicon = parse_narratives("silicon-doc/*.md")
    chip = parse_narratives("chip-gracey/*.md")
    
    # For each instruction
    for instruction in get_all_instructions():
        entry = {}
        
        # Merge from sources by authority
        if chip.has(instruction):
            entry.update(chip[instruction])  # Highest authority
        if silicon.has(instruction):
            entry.merge(silicon[instruction])  # Fill gaps
        if csv.has(instruction):
            entry.merge(csv[instruction])  # Fill more gaps
            
        # Calculate confidence
        entry["confidence"] = calculate_confidence(entry["sources"])
        
        repo["instructions"][instruction] = entry
    
    return repo
```

### Phase 2: Make It Real (1-2 days)

**Option 1: JSON Files**
```
/central-repository/
├── instructions/
│   ├── ADD.json
│   ├── ADDX.json
│   └── ...
├── architecture/
│   ├── cogs.json
│   └── memory.json
└── manifest.json  # Index of everything
```

**Option 2: Single SQLite Database**
```sql
CREATE TABLE knowledge (
    category TEXT,
    key TEXT,
    value JSON,
    confidence REAL,
    sources TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (category, key)
);
```

**Option 3: Modern Document DB**
- MongoDB/DynamoDB style
- Rich querying
- But more complex

### Phase 3: Build the Pipeline (2-3 days)

```
[Ingestion Sources]
        ↓
[Central Repository]  ←── We maintain this
        ↓
    [Outputs]
    ├── Download-on-Demand API
    ├── PDF Documentation
    ├── Interactive Website
    └── AI Training Data
```

## The "How in the World" Answer

### Start with What We Know Works

1. **Pick ONE category first**: Instructions (we have 95% coverage)

2. **Build simple aggregator script**:
```bash
python aggregate_instructions.py \
    --csv sources/p2-instructions-csv/... \
    --silicon sources/silicon-doc/... \
    --chip sources/chip-gracey/... \
    --output central/instructions.json
```

3. **Define minimal schema**:
```yaml
required:
  - mnemonic
  - encoding
  - description
optional:
  - timing
  - flags
  - examples
  - bugs
  - patterns
```

4. **Run it and see what we get**:
- How many conflicts?
- How many gaps?
- How big is it?

5. **Iterate based on reality**:
- Too complex? Simplify
- Missing critical info? Add fields
- Too slow? Optimize

## The Value Proposition

### Why This Is Worth Doing

1. **For Humans**: 
   - One place to check
   - Guaranteed complete answer
   - Confidence ratings

2. **For AI Agents**:
   - Structured data
   - Efficient retrieval
   - Relationship awareness

3. **For Documentation**:
   - Single source for all outputs
   - Consistent information
   - Easy updates

4. **For Maintenance**:
   - Fix once, propagates everywhere
   - Clear audit trail
   - Version control friendly

## My Recommendation: Start as Production Engine

### Why?
1. **Lower risk**: Source docs remain canonical
2. **Faster to build**: Just aggregate, don't create
3. **Proves value**: See if it actually helps
4. **Natural evolution**: Can become master later

### The Minimal Viable Central Repository

```python
# Just 3 files to start
instructions.json   # All 491 instructions
smart_pins.json     # All 32 modes
architecture.json   # Basic P2 structure

# Simple structure
{
    "entity_type": "instruction",
    "id": "ADD",
    "data": {...},
    "meta": {
        "sources": [...],
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "last_updated": "2025-09-02"
    }
}
```

### Test Case: Can We Answer These?

1. "How does ADD work?" → One lookup
2. "What instructions affect C flag?" → One query
3. "Show me all CORDIC operations" → One filter
4. "What's the timing for hub access?" → One reference

If yes → We've succeeded!

## The Path Forward

### Week 1: Proof of Concept
- Build aggregator for instructions only
- Generate central instructions.json
- Build simple query tool
- Test with real questions

### Week 2: Expand Coverage
- Add smart pins
- Add architecture
- Add patterns
- Refine schema

### Week 3: Production Pipeline
- Automate aggregation
- Build validation
- Create update mechanism
- Generate first outputs

### Week 4: Download-on-Demand
- Design API
- Build query endpoint
- Test with AI agent
- Measure efficiency

## The Bottom Line

**Yes, build it.** But:
1. Start simple (just instructions)
2. Keep sources as truth (for now)
3. Focus on aggregation, not creation
4. Prove value before going all-in
5. Let it evolve naturally

This central repository becomes our **knowledge compiler** - taking scattered sources and compiling them into efficient, queryable knowledge.

The shape? **As simple as possible, but no simpler.**

*Sometimes the best architecture is the one that can evolve.*
