# Snapshot Timing and Demo Strategy

## The Critical Constraint: Demo in 1 Week!

This changes everything. We need to be **pragmatic, not perfect**.

## My Recommendation: SNAPSHOT NOW!

### Why Now is the Right Time

1. **We're at 76% coverage** - That's enough for a compelling demo
2. **Instructions are 95%+ complete** - The most important category
3. **Smart Pins at 95%** - Another wow factor
4. **We have Chip's clarifications** - High authority content
5. **Perfect is the enemy of good** - And we need good in 7 days

### The Two-Track Strategy

```
Track 1: Demo System (Days 1-5)
├── Snapshot current knowledge
├── Build minimal central repository  
├── Create simple API
└── Test with real P2 tasks

Track 2: Production System (Post-demo)
├── Continue ingestion
├── Incremental updates
├── Richer schema
└── Full deployment
```

## Week Plan for Demo

### Day 1-2: Snapshot and Build Core Repository
```python
# What to include for demo
demo_repository = {
    "instructions": {
        # All 491 - we have these at 95%+
        "ADD": {...},
        "SUB": {...},
        # ... all from CSV + Silicon Doc + Chip
    },
    "smart_pins": {
        # All 32 modes - we have at 95%
        "uart": {...},
        "spi": {...},
        # ...
    },
    "architecture": {
        # Basic structure - enough for context
        "cogs": "8 parallel processors...",
        "memory": "512KB hub, 512 longs cog...",
        "pipeline": "5-stage, 2 clock baseline..."
    }
}
```

### Day 3-4: Build Download-on-Demand API
```python
# Simple but effective
class P2KnowledgeAPI:
    def query(self, prompt):
        # "Help me write UART code"
        return {
            "instructions": ["WRPIN", "WXPIN", "WYPIN", "RDPIN"],
            "smart_pin_modes": ["async_serial_tx", "async_serial_rx"],
            "examples": [...],
            "confidence": 0.95
        }
```

### Day 5-6: Create Demo Scenarios
1. **"Help me blink an LED"** - Basic pin control
2. **"Create a UART at 115200 baud"** - Smart Pins showcase
3. **"Add two 64-bit numbers"** - Extended precision from Chip
4. **"Debug why my SETQ isn't working"** - Silicon bug awareness

### Day 7: Polish and Test

## The Minimal Viable Richness for Demo

### What We MUST Have
```yaml
instruction:
  syntax: "ADD D,{#}S"          # For code generation
  encoding: "EEEE 0001000..."   # For assembly
  description: "Adds S to D"    # For understanding
  timing: {cog: 2}              # For optimization
  examples: [...]               # For learning
  confidence: 0.95              # For trust
```

### What We Can Skip (For Now)
- Historical evolution
- Deep relationships graph  
- Edge cases (except known bugs)
- Multiple description depths
- Source attribution details

## The Update Strategy Post-Demo

### Incremental Updates Are CHEAP!

```python
def update_central_repository(new_ingestion):
    # Load existing
    repo = load_repository()
    
    # Apply new knowledge
    for item in new_ingestion:
        if item.authority > repo[item.id].authority:
            repo[item.id].update(item)  # Higher authority wins
        else:
            repo[item.id].fill_gaps(item)  # Fill missing fields
    
    # Save updated
    save_repository(repo)
    
    # Regenerate API cache
    rebuild_api_cache()
```

**Time per update: ~5 minutes automated**

### Update Triggers

1. **New Chip Gracey clarification** → Immediate update (high value)
2. **New instruction discovered** → Weekly batch
3. **Bug found** → Immediate update (critical)
4. **Examples added** → Weekly batch
5. **Minor corrections** → Monthly batch

## The Magnitude of Effort

### Initial Build (This Week)
- **Snapshot ingestion**: 2 hours
- **Build central repo**: 1 day
- **Create API**: 1 day
- **Test & polish**: 1 day
- **Total**: 3-4 days intensive

### Ongoing Maintenance
- **Weekly updates**: 30 minutes
  - Run update script
  - Review changes
  - Commit
  
- **Major ingestion** (like today's session): 2 hours
  - Process new sources
  - Resolve conflicts
  - Update confidence scores
  - Test

### The Evolution Path

```
Week 1: Demo MVP
  76% coverage, core features, proves concept
    ↓
Month 1: Production V1
  85% coverage, full richness, public API
    ↓
Month 2: Production V2  
  95% coverage, all relationships, optimized
    ↓
Ongoing: Maintenance Mode
  Updates as needed, community contributions
```

## My Strong Recommendation

### Do This NOW:

1. **FREEZE ingestion at current state** (76% is plenty)
2. **Build simple central repository** (instructions + smart pins)
3. **Create basic API** (query → relevant knowledge chunks)
4. **Demo successfully** (wow factor with real P2 knowledge)
5. **THEN continue enriching** (post-demo, no pressure)

### Why This Works:

- **Good enough for demo** - 76% covers most real tasks
- **Foundation for growth** - Structure supports updates
- **Low maintenance burden** - Updates are incremental
- **Proves the concept** - Shows value immediately
- **Buys time** - Can perfect it after demo

## The Demo Pitch

"Here's Claude Code helping write P2 code with our knowledge system:"

**Developer**: "Help me create a serial port"

**Claude Code** (powered by our API):
```pasm
' Setting up UART at P0/P1, 115200 baud
' Using Smart Pin mode for async serial
    WRPIN   ##P_ASYNC_TX, #0      ' Configure P0 as async TX
    WXPIN   ##115200, #0           ' Set baud rate
    WYPIN   #0, #0                 ' Start pin
    
    WRPIN   ##P_ASYNC_RX, #1      ' Configure P1 as async RX
    ' ... [generated from our knowledge base]
```

**"This is based on 491 instructions, 32 Smart Pin modes, and authoritative knowledge from Chip Gracey himself."**

## Bottom Line

**Snapshot NOW, demo NEXT WEEK, evolve FOREVER**

The update burden is minimal if we build it right. The key is:
1. Automated update scripts
2. Authority-based conflict resolution
3. Incremental changes only
4. Good testing

We're ready. Let's build it!
