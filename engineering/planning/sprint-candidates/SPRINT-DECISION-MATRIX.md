# Sprint Decision Matrix

*Last Updated: 2025-08-19*  
*Next Review: After any sprint completion or dependency change*

## 🚀 AI P2 Developer Enablement Path

### Critical Strategic Insight: Maximize Existing Knowledge First
**We have 80% P2 coverage but don't fully understand what we have**

#### Knowledge Trust Elevation Path (Priority Order)
**Level 0**: Current state - Mix of red (unknown), yellow (folklore), green (verified)
**Level 1**: Understand what we already extracted → Mine existing sources for examples
**Level 2**: Convert reds to yellows → Fill gaps with targeted research
**Level 3**: Convert yellows to greens → Validate folklore against documentation
**Level 4**: Structure understanding → Instruction relationships, patterns, best practices
**Level 5**: Enable demonstration → Show examples from our existing data

### Strategic Priority: Trust Elevation Over New Content
**FIRST**: Maximize and understand our existing 80% coverage
- Mine our existing extractions for the 267 code examples we know exist
- Understand instruction relationships from what we already have (AD-001)
- Validate red/yellow knowledge gaps against our sources (AD-007)
- Structure P2 architectural understanding for consulting (not just coding)

**THEN**: Seek external content only for critical gaps
- OBEX objects only after maximizing internal examples
- External validation only for persistent red zones
- New content only when existing sources exhausted

**Key Insight**: We're sitting on a goldmine of P2 knowledge but haven't fully exploited it. Code generation is secondary to architectural understanding and consulting capability.

- **Market Coverage** (M): How many tiers benefit?
- **Autonomy** (A): Can AI work independently? (modifier, not scored)

#### Autonomy Classifications
- **Fully Autonomous**: AI can complete without human input
- **Preparation Autonomous**: AI prepares, human reviews, AI internalizes
- **Human-AI Collaborative**: Requires active human participation
- **Human-Dependent**: Primarily human work with AI support

**Base Score** = (F × 3) + U + (I × 2) + R + E + P + M (Maximum: 45 points)

#### Knowledge Trust Elevation Scoring (0-5)
- **5 points**: Converts reds to greens OR mines existing sources for capabilities
- **4 points**: Validates yellows to greens OR structures architectural understanding
- **3 points**: Converts reds to yellows OR extracts patterns from existing data
- **2 points**: Enhances understanding of existing knowledge

### Step 2: Market Tier Weighting (cumulative)
🎓 **Educators**: +10 points (curriculum/teaching impact)
🏢 **Commercial P1 Users**: +5 points (migration/expertise leverage)
⚙️ **Professional Developers**: +3 points (consulting/production)
🔧 **Hobbyist Makers**: +1 point (individual learning)

### Step 3: Strategic Bonuses (cumulative)

### Final Strategic Score Calculation
**Strategic Score** = Base Score + Tier Points + Strategic Bonuses

### Decision Priority
1. **Strategic Score** (primary ranking)
2. **Balanced Advancement** (multi-tier preference)
3. **Pedagogical Impact** (teaching enhancement)
4. **Market Tier Coverage** (breadth of benefit)

### Strategic Scoring Example
**Hypothetical Sprint**: "Smart Pin Progressive Teaching Framework"
- Base Score: U(3) + I(4×2) + R(5) + E(4) + P(5) + M(4) = 29
- Tier Points: Educators(10) + Commercial(5) + Professional(3) + Hobbyist(1) = 19
- Bonuses: Multi-Tier(5) + Cross-Experience(3) + Teaching(4) = 12
- **Strategic Score**: 29 + 19 + 12 = **60 points**

## 🎆 Balanced Advancement Philosophy

### Core Principle: Simultaneous Multi-Tier Progress
**NEVER advance only one market tier.** Every sprint should move multiple tiers forward simultaneously:

- ✅ **Preferred**: Sprint benefits Educators + Commercial P1 Users + Professional Developers
- ✅ **Acceptable**: Sprint benefits 2+ market tiers with different experience levels
- ❌ **Avoid**: Sprint only serves single tier (Hobbyist-only, Professional-only, etc.)

### Sprint Selection Priority Framework
1. **Multi-Tier Coverage**: Prioritize sprints serving 3+ market tiers (+5 bonus)
2. **Experience Diversity**: Favor sprints helping Beginners through Experts (+3 bonus)
3. **P1→P2 Migration**: Special attention to Commercial P1 Users (+3 bonus)
4. **Educational Enablement**: Educators get 10x weight due to multiplicative community impact

### Balance Assessment Questions
Before selecting any sprint, ask:
- ❓ "Does this help Educators create better curriculum?"
- ❓ "Does this support P1 users migrating to P2?"
- ❓ "Does this enable Professional developers with embedded consulting?"
- ❓ "Does this provide value to Hobbyist makers?"
- ❓ "What experience levels benefit: Beginners, Migrants, Veterans, Experts?"

**If a sprint only answers 1-2 questions positively, reconsider or enhance scope.**

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### Priority Sprint Sequence: Split Autonomy Strategy

**🤖 IMMEDIATE SPRINT**: Audit Preparation Bundle (Autonomous)
Combines preparation work for both audits:

**Part A: PASM2 Instruction Audit Prep** (Can do NOW)
- Generate comprehensive instruction catalog
- Identify missing clock timing columns
- Create review templates for human
- **Output**: Ready-to-review documents in `human-todos/`
- **Enables**: Human can review when available

**Part B: SPIN2 Code Sample Audit Prep** (Can do NOW)
- Catalog all 267 identified examples
- Create metadata templates
- Organize by manual sections
- **Output**: Ready-to-review catalog in `human-todos/`
- **Enables**: Human can annotate when available

**🔔 TRIGGERED SPRINT**: Post-Processing Bundle (After Human Completion)
Activates when human completes either/both audits:

**Part A: PASM2 Integration** (Triggered by human completion)
- Parse enriched instruction data
- Update instruction reference with timing
- Build performance consulting database
- Elevate trust levels to green

**Part B: SPIN2 Integration** (Triggered by human completion)
- Build searchable pattern library
- Create "show me" response system
- Extract coding patterns
- Generate recommendation engine

**SPRINT #3**: AD-013 Mine ALL Sources for Examples (Score: 73)
- **Combines**: SPIN2 samples + PASM2 examples + any other embedded code
- **Impact**: Complete example catalog from all existing sources
- **Trust Level**: Converts existing embedded examples to accessible demos
- **Enables**: Comprehensive example library without external dependencies

**SPRINT #4**: AD-001 Instruction Matrix from Existing Data (Score: 69)
- **Why Important**: Structure our instruction knowledge into relationships
- **Impact**: Architectural understanding for consulting excellence
- **Trust Level**: Validates patterns from completed narratives
- **Enables**: Proper setup→execute sequences, dependency chains

### What These New Extractions Give Us

**PASM2 Missing Narratives**:
- **What We Have**: Partial PASM2 manual with instruction tables
- **What We're Missing**: Detailed narratives for tail-end instructions
- **Why It Matters**: These narratives explain WHEN and WHY to use instructions
- **Trust Impact**: Moves instruction knowledge from yellow (inferred) to green (documented)

**SPIN2 Code Samples**:
- **What We Have**: V51 manual with 267 identified code examples
- **What We Need**: Extract each example with metadata (page, context, teaches)
- **Why It Matters**: Each example is a trusted pattern for specific P2 features
- **Learning Opportunity**: Analyze examples to understand SPIN2 coding patterns

### Strategic Rationale: Exploit Before Explore
**Why This Approach Works**:
1. **We're data-rich but understanding-poor** - 80% coverage not fully exploited
2. **Examples exist but aren't accessible** - 267 manual examples already ingested
3. **Trust levels unclear** - Mix of verified, folklore, and unknown
4. **External content premature** - Why seek OBEX when internal examples unused?

**The Key Insight**: We should become expert consultants on what we already know before seeking new content. Architectural understanding and trust validation trump code generation.
