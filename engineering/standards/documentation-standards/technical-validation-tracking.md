# Technical Validation Tracking System

*Item-by-item confirmation for technical accuracy*

---

## üéØ The Challenge

Technical documents need EVERY fact validated:
- 491 PASM2 instructions
- Each has timing, encoding, flags, behavior
- That's ~2000+ facts to verify
- Need to track what's verified vs pending

---

## üìä Tracking Approaches

### Approach 1: Validation Checklist Document
```markdown
# PASM2 Instruction Validation Status

## Progress: 127/491 instructions verified (26%)

### A Instructions
- [x] ABS     - Verified by Chip 1/14/24 - "Correct"
- [x] ADD     - Verified by Chip 1/14/24 - "Add note about hub timing"
- [ ] ADDCT1  - Pending review
- [ ] ADDCT2  - Pending review
- [x] ADDPIX  - Verified by Bob 1/13/24 - "Tested, works as documented"

### Status Legend:
‚úÖ Fully verified
üî∂ Verified with notes
‚ùå Errors found
‚è≥ Pending review
```

### Approach 2: Spreadsheet Tracking
```
| Instruction | Encoding | Timing | Flags | Behavior | Reviewer | Date | Notes |
|------------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| ABS        | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ        | Chip     | 1/14  | |
| ADD        | ‚úÖ       | üî∂      | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ        | Chip     | 1/14  | Hub timing note |
| ADDCT1     | ‚è≥       | ‚è≥      | ‚è≥     | ‚è≥        | -        | -     | |
```

### Approach 3: In-Document Annotations
```markdown
### ADD
<!-- VALIDATION: Verified by Chip 1/14/24 -->
<!-- STATUS: Verified with notes -->
<!-- NOTES: Add hub boundary timing -->

**Syntax:** ADD D,{#}S {WC,WZ,WCZ}

**Timing:** 2 clocks
<!-- REVIEW NOTE: 3 clocks when crossing hub boundary -->
```

## üöÄ Chip-Specific Review Process

Since Chip has repo access and uses Claude, we can create a SUPER-EFFICIENT process:

### Interactive Review Guide for Chip
```markdown
# PASM2 Manual Review Guide - For Chip

Hi Chip! This guide helps you efficiently review the PASM2 manual.

## Quick Process:
1. Open `/review/pasm2-review-batch-1.md` (25 instructions)
2. Each instruction has a checkbox
3. Check box if correct, add note if needed
4. Save file, we'll process the rest

## Review File Format:
---
### Instruction: ABS
**What we documented:**
- Encoding: EEEE 1010110 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
- Timing: 2 clocks
- Flags: C = result[31], Z = (result == 0)

**Your Review:**
- [ ] Encoding correct
- [ ] Timing correct  
- [ ] Flags correct
- [ ] Behavior description correct

**Notes (if any):**
[Your comments here]
---

Takes about 30 seconds per instruction.
25 instructions = ~15 minutes per batch.
```

### Batch Processing for Chip
```markdown
/review/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README-FOR-CHIP.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pasm2-review-batch-1.md  (25 instructions A-B)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pasm2-review-batch-2.md  (25 instructions C-D)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pasm2-review-batch-3.md  (25 instructions E-G)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [etc...]

Each batch is bite-sized: 15-20 minutes
Can do one batch per day or all at once
```

---

## ü§ñ Claude-Assisted Review for Chip

### Prompt Template for Chip + Claude:
```markdown
Chip can say to Claude:

"I'm reviewing the PASM2 manual for technical accuracy. 
Please help me review `/review/pasm2-review-batch-1.md`.
For each instruction, I'll tell you if it's correct or what's wrong.
Update the checkboxes and add my notes."

Then Chip just says:
- "ABS - all correct"
- "ADD - timing should note hub boundary adds 1 clock"
- "ADDCT1 - correct"
- etc.

Claude updates the file, Chip reviews Claude's updates, done!
```

### Even Simpler: Voice Review
```
Chip could even do voice-to-text:
"ABS correct, ADD needs hub note, ADDCT1 correct, ADDCT2 correct..."

Claude processes this into the tracking document.
```

## üìà Progress Visualization

### Dashboard Document
```markdown
# PASM2 Manual Validation Dashboard

## Overall Progress
‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 45% (220/491 instructions)

## By Category
- Memory Ops:     ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë 80% verified

- 1/13: Bob verified timing for 10 instructions
- 1/12: Alice found 3 encoding errors (fixed)

## Priority Items
üî¥ Need Chip's review:
- COGINIT behavior in special cases
- Pipeline stall documentation
- Interrupt timing validation
```

---

## üîÑ Embellishment Tracking

### As Reviews Add Information:
```markdown
### Original:
ADD D,S - Adds S to D

### After Review:
ADD D,S - Adds S to D
<!-- EMBELLISHMENT: Added by Chip 1/14 -->
Note: When D is a hub address and the cog is not already 
synchronized to the hub, add 1 clock to the timing.
<!-- END EMBELLISHMENT -->
```

### Tracking Embellishments:
```
| Instruction | Original | Embellishments | Source |
|------------|----------|----------------|---------|
| ADD | Basic description | Hub timing note | Chip |
| MUL | Basic description | Overflow behavior | Bob |
```

- Chip adds ‚úÖ or ‚ùå 
- Comments for notes
- Can do on phone/tablet

### Option 4: Simple Text List
```
Chip sends email/message:
"Reviewed A-instructions:
ABS - good
ADD - need hub note
ADDCT1 - good
ADDCT2 - good
ADDPIX - check flag description
..."
We process into tracking.
```

## üìã Creating Review Batches

### For Efficient Review:
```python
# Pseudo-code for batch creation
instructions = load_all_491_instructions()
batch_size = 25

for batch_num, batch in enumerate(chunks(instructions, batch_size)):
    create_review_file(f"batch-{batch_num}.md", batch)
    include_essential_facts_only()  # Don't overwhelm
    add_simple_checkboxes()
    estimate_time = batch_size * 0.5  # 30 sec per instruction
    add_header(f"Estimated time: {estimate_time} minutes")
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Metrics

### Technical Validation:
- 100% of instructions reviewed
- All timing validated
- All encodings verified
- All flags confirmed

### Efficiency Metrics:
- Review time per instruction: < 1 minute
- Batch completion rate
- Issues found vs total reviewed
- Time to fix issues

---

## üîê Special Considerations for Chip

### Make It Enjoyable:
- Small batches (not overwhelming)
- Show progress (satisfying to complete)
- Quick wins (easy ones first)
- Flexible timing (his schedule)

### Preserve His Input:
- Every note from Chip is gold
- Track attribution carefully
- Distinguish his input from others
- Archive his exact words
