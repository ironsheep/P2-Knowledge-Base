## üéØ Spec Sheet Style Template

### Structure:
```markdown
# [Product Name] Spec Sheet

[2-3 sentence positioning paragraph - performance claims, key differentiators, target applications]

[1 sentence about ecosystem/development environment benefits]

## Selected Specifications
‚óè [Core count] processors @ [speed]
‚óè [Memory size] of [type]
‚óè [I/O count] with [capability]
‚óè [Power specs]
‚óè [Temperature range]

## Physical Characteristics
‚óè Package: [type and dimensions]
‚óè Temperature: [range with standard]
‚óè Moisture: [MSL rating]

## Compliance
‚óè [Standard]: [Number]
‚óè [Standard]: [Number]

## Hardware Function Highlights
‚óè [Feature Category]: [Impressive quantity/capability]
‚óè [Feature Category]: [Multiple options listed]
‚óè [Protocol Support]: [List of protocols]

[Website and contact information]
```

### Writing Rules:

1. **Lead with value proposition**
   - Compare to known technologies (FPGA, MPU)
   - Emphasize time/cost savings
   - Highlight unique capabilities

2. **Use "Selected Specifications"**
   - Cherry-pick impressive numbers
   - Round to memorable values
   - Group related features

3. **Maximize perceived capability**
   - List all supported protocols
   - Show breadth of features
   - Use quantity multipliers (64x, 8x)

4. **Simplify technical concepts**
   - "Smart I/Os" not "configurable pin modes"
   - "Shared RAM" not detailed memory architecture
   - Remove addressing complexity

5. **Include disclaimer for protocols**
   - "For R&D only" caveat
   - User licensing responsibility
