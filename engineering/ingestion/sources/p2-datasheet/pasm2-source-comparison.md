# PASM2 Instruction Sources Comparison

## Sources Analyzed
1. **P2 Datasheet Tables** (Just extracted)
   - Source: P2X8C4M64P Datasheet pages 36-46
   - Format: Tables with 3 columns (Instruction, Description, Clocks)
   - Instructions: ~450 documented

2. **P2 Instructions v35 CSV** (Previously extracted)
   - Source: Chip Gracey's official spreadsheet
   - Format: CSV with instruction inventory
   - Instructions: 491 entries (365 core + 126 variants)

## Key Findings

### üü¢ AGREEMENTS (What Both Sources Confirm)

1. **Instruction Count**: Both sources show approximately the same total (~450-491 instructions)
2. **Categories**: Both organize instructions into similar functional groups
3. **Core Operations**: All major instructions appear in both sources
4. **Encoding Format**: Both confirm 32-bit instruction width with EEEE OOOOOOO CZI format

### üî¥ CRITICAL ENRICHMENTS

#### Datasheet Provides (CSV Lacks):
1. **DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS**
   - Full operational descriptions for every instruction
   - Mathematical formulas (e.g., "D = D + S", "C = carry of (D + S)")
   - Flag effects with specific conditions
   - Special behavior notes (asterisks indicating Z flag updates)

2. **TIMING INFORMATION**
   - Precise clock cycles for each instruction
   - Variable timing notation (e.g., "13...20" for hub window alignment)
   - Conditional timing (e.g., "2 or 4" for branch taken/not taken)
   - Memory-specific timing (Cog&LUT / Hub differences)
   - Complex timing formulas (e.g., "9...16, +1 if crosses hub long")

3. **OPERATIONAL CONTEXT**
   - Prerequisites (e.g., "Used after RDFAST")
   - Instruction relationships (e.g., "Prior SETQ overrides...")
   - State effects (e.g., "FIFO IN USE")
   - Hardware limitations (e.g., "ILLEGAL" for certain combinations)

#### CSV Provides (Datasheet Lacks):
1. **COMPLETE ENUMERATION**
   - 491 total entries including all aliases and variants
   - Distinction between core instructions (365) and variants (126)
   - More systematic categorization count

2. **ENCODING DETAILS**
   - Binary encoding pattern breakdown
   - Bit field specifications
   - Opcode structure visualization

3. **VARIANT TRACKING**
   - Multiple forms of same instruction tracked separately
   - Alias identification

### üìä SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES

#### Instruction Naming
- **Datasheet**: Shows operand patterns (e.g., "D,{#}S {WC/WZ/WCZ}")
- **CSV**: Lists as separate entries without operand details

#### Clock Timing Representation
| Instruction | Datasheet | CSV |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| CALL | "4 / 13...20" | Not provided |
| RDLONG | "9...16 / 9...26" | Not provided |
| MUL | "2" | Not provided |
| QDIV | "2...9" | Not provided |

#### Description Depth
- **Datasheet**: "Add S into D, signed. D = D + S. C = correct sign of (D + S). *"
- **CSV**: No descriptions, only instruction names

### üîÑ COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

The sources are **highly complementary** rather than conflicting:

1. **CSV** provides the complete inventory and structure
2. **Datasheet** provides the operational details and timing
3. Together they form a complete reference

### ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

1. **Instruction Count Discrepancy**
   - CSV: 491 entries
   - Datasheet: ~450 instructions
   - Reason: CSV counts variants separately, datasheet groups them

2. **No actual operational conflicts found** - sources agree on all fundamentals

### üí° INSIGHTS

1. **Datasheet is Essential for**:
   - Understanding what instructions actually do
   - Timing-critical code
   - Flag manipulation
   - Hardware interaction details

2. **CSV is Essential for**:
   - Complete instruction inventory
   - Systematic categorization
   - Encoding format understanding
   - Compiler/assembler implementation

3. **Missing from Both**:
   - Detailed opcode values for each instruction
   - Pipeline interaction details
   - Instruction pairing rules
   - Power consumption data

## Recommendations

### For AI Training
1. **Use BOTH sources** - they're complementary, not redundant
2. **Datasheet first** for understanding operations
3. **CSV for** complete enumeration and structure
4. **Cross-reference** for validation

### For Documentation
1. **Merge the sources** into a unified reference:
   - CSV structure and enumeration
   - Datasheet descriptions and timing
   - Add opcode values from binary analysis
   - Include usage examples from code samples

### Data Quality Assessment
- **No conflicts** in operational definitions
- **Rich complementary** information
- **High confidence** in combined accuracy
- **Production ready** for AI training

## Summary

The two sources are **perfectly complementary**:
- **CSV**: Complete structural inventory (the "what")
- **Datasheet**: Complete operational details (the "how" and "when")
- **Together**: Comprehensive PASM2 reference

There are **no meaningful conflicts**, only different levels of detail and organization. The combination of both sources provides the most complete picture of the P2 instruction set available.
