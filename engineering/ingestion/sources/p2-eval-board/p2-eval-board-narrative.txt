Note: commenting is enabled, so please feel free to request clarification on any point.
The Propeller Eval Board is designed for experimentation and characterization of the
Propeller multicore microcontroller. The Propeller features a user-code adjustable
operating frequency, and has been designed to operate at a maximum recommended
clock frequency of
MHz.
Multiple ground points, power supplies, and power enable breakout headers are
included for simpler testing and interfacing with standard test equipment. The PCB is
organized to keep each subsystem clearly defined in groups, and spaced well apart,
making room for test probes to be attached.
The eight I/O Pin Breakout Edge Headers accommodate the x pass-through headers on
eight different accessory add-ons, for experimenting with HyperBus memory, audio,
video, and more. See the Propeller product family page for options.

The P -EVAL board is supplied with the jumper located on the V pin only,
and not connected to the ACC HDR pin. This is the “OFF” position, and
means that power is not routed from the V output pin to each of the edge
headers via the ACC HDR pin.
To enable the V supply at the edge headers, move the jumper across both pins to join
them together. Certain accessory boards require a V supply, such as the USB accessory

The PC-USB port includes protection that will disable the supply if
mA current draw is
exceeded. When using the Propeller with an external USB hub, be sure to use a
powered hub.
If an alternative power source is connected to the AUX USB Port, that port will take
precedence and power from the PC USB socket will be disabled. However, the PC USB
socket will continue to function as a serial connection to the computer, and the PC USB
“ON” LED will remain lit while the PC USB port is connected to your computer and is
active.
While transmitting or receiving data, the ACT blue LED will blink to indicate your
computer is communicating with the P -EVAL Board.
When a short circuit, over-current, or over-temperature fault condition is detected by the
USB protection circuit, power will be disconnected and the corresponding red fault LED,
marked by a warning triangle label, will light until the fault is remedied.
In the special case that the PC USB connection is suspended by your computer, the “ON”
LED will go off, and the blue ACT LED may glow dimly. It would usually be necessary to
unplug/reconnect the USB cable in this situation, so that the computer can renegotiate
the USB connection.
5.
BL
&P
The USB Logic and Protection section is the bridge between the USB power sources and
the common V rail which provides power to the LDO VIN header, ACC HDR and the VDD
Power Supply.
The USB power source is selected automatically, either from the PC USB socket or
preferentially from the AUX USB port if a higher current power supply is connected. Each
power source has its own current limit: PC-USB is
mA, AUX-USB is
mA.
In case of over-current, short-circuit, or over-temperature, the USB Logic IC’s will shut
down, disconnect power, and light the corresponding fault LED to indicate the problem.

6. DD P
The VDD power supply is for the Propeller core. This onboard power supply is based on
a switching buck regulator, capable of delivering A at . V. Short circuit, over-current
protection and brownout detection are also included.
VDD is typically expected to be . V. This voltage powers the internal circuits of the P
microcontroller. In case of a serious prolonged short-circuit or over-voltage condition, the
VDD regulator will shutdown and remain locked off to prevent any serious damage. In

this case, the short-circuit should be remedied, and then the power supply will need to
be power-cycled to attempt a restart. If the fault remains, then the VDD regulator will
immediately go into the shut-down and locked off state again.
The VDD power supply includes Brown-out Detection, which will keep the P in reset
whilst VDD is below approximately . V.

connections. Operational frequency is adjustable; for full operating frequency
configuration details, options, and limits, refer to the Propeller Rev B Silicon Google
Document.
The Propeller s on-chip crystal oscillator with internal pF load capacitance drives the
MHz crystal to provide a base clock frequency for the Propeller. The actual operating
frequency is selected in code, and can be almost any value or fractional value by using
three special multiply and divide registers.
XO / XI Pads

The pads marked XO and XI above the oscillator are connected directly to the on-board
oscillator and the Propeller XO Xtal Out, physical pin
and XI Xtal In, physical pin

pins. Test equipment could be connected to these pads, or an alternative clock source
connected to XI. Note that the P -ES Eval board has a
MHz crystal, and the clock
source type and frequency must be specified in the user code; refer to the Propeller
Rev B Silicon Google Document.
Overclocking

The clock frequency of Propeller is defined by user code. It can be adjusted very
precisely using three multiply and divide registers that set the actual operating frequency
based on a function of the crystal oscillator frequency.
All this means that overclocking is possible and early unsupported experiments have
been running the Propeller overclocked at
MHz without significant heat rise!
While special cooling arrangements are not typically required when operating at the
recommended maximum clock frequency of
MHz, the Propeller ES Evaluation
Board bottom layer features a continuous oz copper ground plane which is designed to
remove heat from the Propeller . There are also four mounting holes spaced mm
apart, which could accommodate a mm fan or heatsink.

When power is connected to AUX USB, this will automatically take priority over power
from the lower current PC-USB port. The AUX USB port includes protection that will
disable the supply if A current draw is exceeded.

The header for P to P has the RES pin beside the V
pin. The RES pin is active low, and is connected to the Propeller
microcontroller RESn circuit. Momentarily set this pin low to
reset the Propeller. This header is ideal for connecting to a WiFi
module such as the Parallax WX Module :
https://www.parallax.com/product/
s , in order to
program the Propeller wirelessly.
Ti When using wireless programming it is recommended to
switch off the USB Reset “USB RES” feature at the Mode
Selection Switch Bank.

12. LED B
This bank of eight LEDs is connected via an LED Buffer to pins P through P . The
buffer isolates the LEDs so they will not influence the I/O signals. P -P LEDs are
connected to the USB data and P memory signals see I/O Pin Assignments so these
LEDs will be especially active at power-up and after a reset.
After start-up, some of the LEDs can be used as user-programmable indicators. For
example, P and P are free by default.

13. R
B
Use the Reset button button to restart the Propeller microcontroller’s program and also
power cycle the flash memory and microSD socket. Press and hold to keep the
microcontroller in reset. Press and release to reset and execute the selected Propeller
boot sequence; see the Boot Mode Selection for the necessary switch settings.

14. LDO
I/O P
The LDO regulators are fixed . V low-noise regulators, which power the P I/O
smart-pins. Each regulator has short-circuit and over-current protection. You may see this
voltage referred to as VIO Voltage for IO , or by group of I/O pins in the format Vxxxx.
At the actual microcontroller, the Propeller Smart I/O pins are grouped such that each
I/O’s have a dedicated voltage supply connection. If you refer to the diagram Propeller
Physical Pins you will see the voltage supply connections labelled as V
, V
,
V
, etc.

This allows pins that will be performing sensitive analog functions to use dedicated quiet,
local . V regulation.
With the P -EVAL PCB, the voltage supply connections have been brought out in groups
of
I/O pins each. Each group has a VIO output labelled Vxxxx at each of the
corresponding I/O Pin Breakout Edge Headers, which describes the I/O range that the
LDO supplies. For example, V
would mean VIO voltage for I/O pins to .
Note: While it would also be typical to have a single larger switching regulator to power
all the . V I/O supplies, the distributed LDO’s allow for better local regulation, low
noise, isolation of I/O groups, improved protection, less voltage drop under load, and
better thermal characteristics.

This bank of dip switches controls the USB Reset and Boot Mode Selection functions. The
dip switches are not set to any particular state on a new Eval board, although the four
switches will all usually be set to the OFF position.
USB RES (USB Reset Connection)

This switch controls the connection of the USB “DTR” Reset signal to the Propeller reset
circuit. Switch ON to allow the PC-USB interface to reset the propeller by toggling the DTR
signal as required for PC-USB programming . Switch OFF to disable that reset signal.
This switch would usually be kept switched ON for programming via PC-USB cable, and
switched OFF for programming via an external serial programmer or WiFi module
connected to the top-left P /P
edge header.

Boot Mode Selection

Upon startup or after reset, the Propeller will always proceed according to the boot
mode selection table shown below. The three switches labelled Flash, P
and P
are used to select the Boot Mode, and the options include booting loading code from
USB-Serial, SD card or SPI Flash memory.

Power for the microSD card socket is supplied by the Common LDO regulator, which has
an optional connection to P that would allow user code to toggle power on/off. Refer
to the Common LDO regulator section for more details.

19. C
LDO
The Common LDO regulator is a fixed . V low-noise
regulator. It powers the microSD card and SPI Flash memory
chip, and also provides a common pull-up voltage for boot
mode features.
R
is an unpopulated pad that would connect P to the
Common LDO enable pin. This would allow the user to
power-cycle the microSD card, perhaps for code
development and experimentation.
One option to use this feature would be to move R
to R
, and then install an
kΩ resistor at R
. It is not recommended to keep both R
and R
installed.
Consult the schematic before making adjustments and proceed at your own risk!

20. LED B
The LED buffer is an octal line driver that has high impedance connections to P –P ,
and drives the corresponding status LED in the LED Bank on when the P I/O signal line is
low.
All I/O signals from the P microcontroller are high impedance by default, which means
the LEDs will be sensitive to objects moving close to the top-left edge header that
provides access to the P –P pins.
In user code those pins could be driven high or low, or have I/O pin pull-ups activated, to
control the LEDs without the high-impedance behaviour. Another option is for the user
application or breakout board to add pull-up resistors at the relevant edge header pins.
This design choice means that those I/O pins are not impacted by the presence of the
LEDs or external pull-up resistors by default, and are completely flexible and free for the
user to use as required.
