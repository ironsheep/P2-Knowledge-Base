# Busy-Wait Lock Antipattern

**Extract Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Authority Level**: Maximum (P2 Designer) - Antipattern identified through analysis

**Original File**: flash_fs.spin2 (pattern avoided in implementation)

## Antipattern Description

**Infinite Busy-Wait Lock Acquisition** - The problematic pattern of repeatedly attempting lock acquisition without yielding CPU time or implementing timeouts, potentially blocking system operation.

## ‚ùå Problematic Implementation

```spin2
' ANTIPATTERN: Infinite busy-wait without yield
PUB badLockAcquisition()
  ' This blocks forever if lock is never available
  repeat while locktry(fsLock) == 0
    ' No yield, no timeout, no escape - blocks other COG operations
    
  ' Critical section
  performOperation()
  
  lockrel(fsLock)
```

**Problems with This Approach**:
- **CPU Waste**: Consumes 100% CPU time while waiting
- **COG Blocking**: Prevents COG from performing other useful work
- **No Timeout**: Could block indefinitely if lock holder crashes
- **Poor Responsiveness**: System becomes unresponsive during contention
- **No Error Handling**: Cannot detect or report lock acquisition failures

## ‚úÖ P2-Optimized Alternative (From Flash Filesystem)

```spin2
' CORRECT PATTERN: Smart lock acquisition with options
PUB smartLockAcquisition() : success
  ' Option 1: Non-blocking with immediate return
  if locktry(fsLock)
    ' Got lock immediately
    performOperation()
    lockrel(fsLock)
    return true
  else
    ' Lock busy - return immediately
    LONG[@errorCode][cogid()] := ERROR_RESOURCE_BUSY
    return false

' ENHANCED PATTERN: Timeout with yield capability
PUB lockWithTimeout(timeoutMS) : success | startTime
  startTime := CNT
  
  repeat while locktry(fsLock) == 0
    ' P2-optimized timeout check using CNT counter
    if (CNT - startTime) / (clkfreq / 1000) > timeoutMS
      LONG[@errorCode][cogid()] := ERROR_TIMEOUT
      return false
      
    ' Optional: Yield time slice to other COGs
    waitms(1)  ' Brief yield - allows other COGs to work
    
  ' Successfully acquired lock
  performOperation()
  lockrel(fsLock)
  return true

' ADVANCED PATTERN: Exponential backoff
PUB lockWithBackoff(maxTimeoutMS) : success | attempts, backoffMS, startTime
  attempts := 0
  backoffMS := 1
  startTime := CNT
  
  repeat while locktry(fsLock) == 0
    ' Check total timeout
    if (CNT - startTime) / (clkfreq / 1000) > maxTimeoutMS
      LONG[@errorCode][cogid()] := ERROR_TIMEOUT
      return false
      
    ' Exponential backoff - wait longer each attempt
    waitms(backoffMS)
    backoffMS := backoffMS * 2 #> 100  ' Cap at 100ms
    attempts++
    
  ' Success - record attempt count for analysis
  LONG[@lockAttempts][cogid()] := attempts
  performOperation()
  lockrel(fsLock)
  return true
```

## Why the Alternative is Better

**Resource Efficiency**:
- **CPU Conservation**: Doesn't waste CPU cycles in tight loops
- **COG Cooperation**: Allows other COGs to perform useful work
- **System Responsiveness**: Maintains system responsiveness under contention

**Robustness**:
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents infinite blocking scenarios
- **Error Reporting**: Clear indication when lock acquisition fails
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning when resources are busy

**P2-Specific Advantages**:
- **CNT Counter**: Uses P2's high-resolution counter for precise timeouts
- **Multi-COG Awareness**: Designed for P2's multi-COG architecture
- **Hardware Optimization**: Leverages P2's efficient timing capabilities

## When This Antipattern Appears

**Common Scenarios**:
- **Simple Examples**: Tutorial code that doesn't consider real-world constraints
- **Single-COG Thinking**: Code written without considering multi-COG environment
- **Quick Prototypes**: Early development code that never gets production-hardened
- **Ported Code**: Code ported from single-threaded environments

**Warning Signs**:
```spin2
' RED FLAGS - These patterns indicate potential problems
repeat while locktry(lock) == 0    ' No timeout or yield
repeat until locktry(lock)          ' Infinite retry without escape
while not locktry(lock)             ' Blocking without consideration
```

## How to Avoid This Antipattern

### Design Principles:
1. **Always Plan for Contention**: Assume locks will be busy sometimes
2. **Implement Timeouts**: Every lock acquisition should have a maximum wait time
3. **Consider Alternatives**: Can the operation be deferred or done differently?
4. **Error Handling**: Always provide graceful failure paths
5. **COG Cooperation**: Design for multi-COG environments from the start

### Implementation Guidelines:
```spin2
' TEMPLATE: Good lock acquisition pattern
PUB templateLockOperation() : success
  ' 1. Try immediate acquisition first
  if locktry(resourceLock)
    ' Quick path - got lock immediately
  else
    ' 2. Implement appropriate strategy based on requirements
    if critical_operation
      success := lockWithTimeout(5000)  ' 5 second timeout for critical ops
    else
      ' 3. Non-critical - fail fast
      LONG[@errorCode][cogid()] := ERROR_RESOURCE_BUSY
      return false
      
  if success
    ' 4. Perform operation in critical section
    performOperation()
    
    ' 5. Always release lock
    lockrel(resourceLock)
    
  return success
```

## P2-Specific Considerations

**COG Architecture Impact**:
- P2 has 8 COGs that should cooperate, not compete
- Busy-waiting in one COG affects overall system performance
- P2's event system provides better alternatives for waiting

**Hardware Alternatives**:
- **Event System**: Use P2 events instead of polling
- **Smart Pins**: Hardware-based signaling for coordination
- **Mailbox Pattern**: Message passing instead of shared resource locking
