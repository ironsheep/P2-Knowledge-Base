## 5. MISSING INFORMATION AUDIT

### Still Missing from Silicon Doc

#### Critical Gaps
❌ **Boot Process** - Marked "needs more editing"
❌ **Bytecode System** - Marked "to be completed"
❌ **Individual Instruction Semantics** - Not covered

#### Partial Coverage
⚠️ **USB Implementation** - Mode mentioned, no details
⚠️ **Smart Pin Modes** - Overview only, details elsewhere
⚠️ **Electrical Specifications** - None included

### Questions Silicon Doc Raises But Doesn't Answer
1. Complete boot sequence?
2. Boot ROM contents?
3. USB protocol details?
4. Individual instruction descriptions?
5. Bytecode interpreter operation?

## 6. CROSS-REFERENCE AUDIT

### Information Verified Across Sources
| Information | Silicon Doc | Hardware Manual | PASM2 Manual | Consensus |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| COG Count | 8 | 8 | 8 | ✅ |
| Hub RAM | 512KB | 512KB | 512KB | ✅ |
| Pipeline | 5-stage | - | - | Single source |
| Smart Pins | 64 | 64 | 64 | ✅ |
| CORDIC Ops | 8 | - | - | Single source |

## 7. COMPLETENESS AUDIT

### Section Completeness Assessment

## KEY FINDING

**The Silicon Doc V2 extraction is dramatically superior to V1:**
- 2x more content extracted
- 24x more tables preserved
- Perfect special character preservation
- Complete section structure

This document remains our **architectural foundation** but needs supplementation for:
- Boot process (use Hardware Manual)
- Instruction details (use PASM2 Manual)
- I/O specifics (use Smart Pins)
