This FIFO interface allows hub RAM to be either sequentially   read or sequentially written in any combination of bytes, words, or longs, at any rate, up to one long per clock. No matter the   transfer frequency or the word size, the FIFO will ensure that the cog's reads or writes are all properly conducted from or to the   composite hub RAM.",
