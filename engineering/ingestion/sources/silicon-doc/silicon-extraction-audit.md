## üìä Cross-Reference Validation

### Against PASM2 Spreadsheet
- **Matches**: 491 instruction count ‚úÖ
- **Matches**: Instruction categories ‚úÖ
- **Matches**: Flag operations ‚úÖ
- **Enriches**: Adds timing details the spreadsheet lacks

### Against Smart Pins Doc
- **Consistent**: Mode numbers match ‚úÖ
- **Complementary**: Silicon gives overview, Smart Pins gives examples
- **No conflicts**: Parameter usage aligns

### Against PASM2 Manual (Partial)
- **Consistent**: Instruction formats match ‚úÖ
- **Gap**: Manual has more instruction detail
- **Gap**: Silicon has more architecture context

## ‚ùì Identified Gaps & Questions

### Critical Gaps
1. **Boot Process**: Incomplete by original author
2. **Instruction Details**: Need individual specifications
3. **Bytecode Execution**: Author marked "(to be completed.)"
4. **USB Details**: Mode exists but not documented

### Unanswered Questions
1. How does boot device selection work?
2. What are the silicon errata/workarounds?
3. How do bytecode instructions map to PASM2?
4. What are the USB endpoint configurations?
5. What determines 8-cog vs 16-cog modes?

### Documentation Conflicts
- **None identified** - Sources align where they overlap

## üéØ Required Actions

### To Complete Extraction
1. **Find alternate boot documentation** (or mark as unavailable)
2. **Extract remaining instruction details** (if present)
3. **Document what's permanently missing**
4. **Create "known gaps" list for users**

### To Improve Quality
1. **Add cross-references** between related sections
2. **Create instruction index** pointing to details
3. **Build terminology glossary**
4. **Generate quick reference tables**

## üìä Final Assessment

**Extraction Health**: üü° PARTIAL

**Strengths**:
- Excellent architecture coverage
- Complete hardware feature documentation
- Good cross-source consistency

**Weaknesses**:
- Missing individual instruction details
- Incomplete boot process (author's gap)
- No electrical specifications

**Recommendation**:
1. Accept current extraction as "Silicon Architecture Reference"
2. Don't attempt to extract missing instructions (use PASM2 manual)
3. Document boot process gap for community contribution
4. Move forward with synthesis using what we have
