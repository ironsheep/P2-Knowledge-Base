# PNUT_TS PASM2 Condition Codes - Validation Checklist

## Phase 1: Source Acquisition ✅
- [x] File copied to ingestion folder
- [x] Source metadata documented
- [x] File integrity verified
- [x] JSON structure validated

## Phase 2: Content Analysis ✅
- [x] Condition code count verified (16)
- [x] Effect flag count verified (4)
- [x] Data structure documented
- [x] Key fields presence confirmed
- [x] Quality indicators assessed

## Phase 3: Internal Consistency (In Progress)
- [ ] Condition code value uniqueness validation
- [ ] Binary pattern uniqueness validation  
- [ ] Alias consistency validation
- [ ] Category assignment validation
- [ ] Effect flag bit pattern validation
- [ ] Cross-reference completeness check

## Phase 4: External Validation (Pending)
- [ ] Compare against existing instruction conditional usage
- [ ] Identify condition codes used in YAML files
- [ ] Flag effect flag usage patterns in instructions
- [ ] Cross-reference with enhanced instruction database
- [ ] Validate condition code coverage completeness

## Phase 5: Integration Planning (Pending)
- [ ] Identify enhancement opportunities for instructions
- [ ] Plan condition code documentation integration
- [ ] Design instruction-condition code cross-references
- [ ] Plan conditional execution documentation

## Phase 6: Knowledge Base Enhancement (Pending)
- [ ] Create condition code reference documentation
- [ ] Link condition codes to instruction usage
- [ ] Enhance instruction YAML with condition code references
- [ ] Update instruction examples with conditional execution

## Success Criteria
- All validations pass
- Integration plan created
- Enhancement opportunities documented
- Condition code usage mapped to instructions
