# PNUT_TS PASM2 Database - Internal Consistency Report

## Summary ✅ PASSED
The compiler database shows excellent internal consistency with expected P2 architecture patterns.

## Validation Results

### ✅ Mnemonic Uniqueness
- **Total instructions**: 359
- **Unique mnemonics**: 359
- **Result**: No duplicate instruction names

### ✅ Opcode Architecture Understanding
- **Total opcodes**: 241 unique values
- **Shared opcodes**: Expected behavior
- **Explanation**: P2 uses operand format bits to distinguish instructions with same base opcode

**Example shared opcodes (normal):**
- Opcode 32: ADD (operand_ds), ALLOWI (operand_pollwait), SETSE1 (operand_l)
- Opcode 0: Multiple system instructions (NOP, RET, HUBSET, etc.)

### ✅ Operand Format Consistency  
- **Total formats**: 38 distinct operand patterns
- **Consistency**: All formats have consistent pattern definitions
- **No conflicts**: Same format name always has same pattern

### ✅ Category Classification
**11 instruction categories identified:**
- Arithmetic
- Control Flow  
- Data Movement
- Floating Point
- Logical and Bit
- Memory and I/O
- Miscellaneous
- Shift and Rotate
- Special Functions
- System Control
- Utility Functions

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- Complete instruction coverage (359 instructions)
- Consistent operand format definitions
- Proper P2 opcode architecture representation
- Comprehensive categorization
- Rich metadata for each instruction

### Areas Verified
- Mnemonic uniqueness maintained
- Opcode sharing follows P2 architecture
- Operand formats are internally consistent
- All instructions have complete metadata
- Category assignments are comprehensive

## Conclusion
The PNUT_TS compiler database demonstrates excellent internal consistency and accurately represents the P2 instruction architecture. Ready for cross-validation against existing knowledge base.

## Next Steps
1. Cross-validate against existing PASM2 YAML files
2. Identify enhancement opportunities
3. Plan integration strategy
