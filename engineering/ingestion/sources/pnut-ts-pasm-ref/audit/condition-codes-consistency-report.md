# PNUT_TS Condition Codes - Internal Consistency Report

## Summary ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISCREPANCY FOUND
The condition codes file shows excellent internal consistency but reveals a **critical mismatch** with the instruction database regarding effect flag values that requires compiler-side investigation.

## Validation Results

### ‚úÖ Internal Consistency (PASSED)
- **Condition codes**: 16 unique values (0-15) with no conflicts
- **Effect flags**: 4 unique values (0-3) with no conflicts  
- **Binary patterns**: All patterns correctly match numeric values
- **Metadata counts**: Actual data matches claimed counts
- **Data completeness**: All required fields present and valid

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FINDING: Effect Flag Value Mismatch**

#### Instruction Database (First File) Values:
- **WC (Write Carry)**: Value = 1
- **WZ (Write Zero)**: Value = 2  
- **WCZ (Write Both)**: Value = 3

#### Condition Codes (Second File) Values:
- **WC (Write Carry)**: Value = 2
- **WZ (Write Zero)**: Value = 1
- **WCZ (Write Both)**: Value = 3

#### Impact Assessment
- **WC and WZ values are swapped** between the two files
- **WCZ value is consistent** (both files agree on 3)
- This affects **binary encoding** of instruction effect flags
- Could impact **compilation accuracy** if wrong values used

#### Examples of Affected Instructions
All instructions with WC/WZ effects show this discrepancy:
- ADD, MOV, CMP, RDLONG, and many others

## Investigation Required

### Questions for Compiler Team
1. **Which encoding is correct** - WC=1,WZ=2 or WC=2,WZ=1?
2. **Source of discrepancy** - Different extraction methods or compiler versions?
3. **Canonical reference** - Which part of compiler source is authoritative?
4. **Impact scope** - Does this affect instruction encoding or just internal representation?

### Verification Strategy
1. **Check P2 datasheet** - Official specification for effect flag encoding
2. **Examine compiler source** - Look at actual instruction encoding logic
3. **Test compilation** - Verify which values produce correct binary output
4. **Community validation** - Check against known working P2 code

## Recommendations

### ‚ö° **IMMEDIATE ACTION: PAUSE INTEGRATION**
- **Do not proceed** with condition codes integration until resolved
- **Do not update** existing YAML files with potentially incorrect values
- **Document thoroughly** to prevent confusion

### üîç **Investigation Phase**
- Request compiler team assessment of value discrepancy
- Maintain both files as separate sources until resolution
- Prepare to update whichever source is determined incorrect

### üìã **Resolution Planning**
- Once canonical values determined, update incorrect source
- Re-run validation with corrected values
- Complete integration with verified effect flag values

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths Confirmed
- Complete condition code coverage (0-15)
- Rich alias documentation for usability
- Proper categorization (Comparison, Logical, Special)
- Binary pattern precision for encoding

### Critical Issue Identified
- Effect flag value inconsistency between compiler analysis files
- Requires authoritative resolution before knowledge base updates

## Next Steps

1. **WAIT** for compiler team assessment of WC/WZ value discrepancy
2. **CORRECT** whichever source file has incorrect values
3. **RE-VALIDATE** consistency after correction
4. **PROCEED** with integration using verified values

**Status**: Integration PAUSED pending compiler-side verification
