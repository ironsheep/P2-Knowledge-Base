PASM2 Manual Development - Working Materials and Format Analysis

This source represents the development workspace for creating the official PASM2 instruction manual. Rather than being an existing document to ingest, this is a collection of materials, screenshots, and specifications gathered to produce a new PASM2 manual matching Parallax's official documentation format.

Purpose and Scope:
This directory serves as the central repository for all materials related to developing a professional PASM2 manual that adheres to Parallax's documentation standards. It contains reference materials, format specifications, and template development resources.

Reference Materials:
The directory includes several screenshots from the official Parallax PASM2 Manual that serve as format references:
- Title page layout showing proper branding and typography
- Body pages demonstrating table formatting and instruction layout
- Table of contents structure and organization
- Convention pages explaining notation and symbols used throughout

Format Specifications Extracted:
Through analysis of the reference screenshots, detailed format specifications have been documented:
- Typography requirements (fonts, sizes, weights)
- Color schemes (Parallax blue #0067A0, accent colors)
- Layout specifications (margins, spacing, alignment)
- Table formatting standards
- Code presentation styles
- Visual hierarchy principles

Template Development Status:
A LaTeX template (p2kb-pasm2-manual.latex) has been created to replicate the official format:
- Implements Parallax visual identity
- Provides instruction documentation structure
- Includes proper table formatting
- Supports code examples and diagrams
- Maintains consistent styling throughout

Materials Organization:
The development materials are organized across several locations:
- Template files in /pipelines/templates/p2kb-catalog/
- Test generation in /engineering/pdf-forge/production/
- Screenshot references in this directory
- Format specifications documented in markdown

Work Product Goals:
The ultimate goal is to produce:
- A complete PASM2 instruction reference manual
- Professional PDF output matching Parallax standards
- Comprehensive coverage of all P2 instructions
- Clear examples and usage patterns
- Proper indexing and cross-referencing

Development Methodology:
The approach involves:
1. Analyzing official format through screenshots
2. Extracting precise specifications
3. Implementing in LaTeX template
4. Testing with sample content
5. Iterating based on output quality
6. Finalizing with complete instruction set

Current Status:
- Format analysis: Complete
- Basic template: Created
- Test workflow: Established
- Missing elements: ADD instruction table examples
- Next phase: Template refinement and content population

This is not a source document for ingestion but rather a workspace for creating new documentation. The materials here inform the production of the PASM2 manual rather than providing content to be extracted.

Value for Knowledge Base:
While not providing direct instruction information, this source is valuable for:
- Understanding Parallax documentation standards
- Replicating official format in new documents
- Maintaining consistency across P2 documentation
- Ensuring professional presentation quality

The work here bridges the gap between raw instruction data (from CSVs and other sources) and professionally formatted documentation suitable for end users.
