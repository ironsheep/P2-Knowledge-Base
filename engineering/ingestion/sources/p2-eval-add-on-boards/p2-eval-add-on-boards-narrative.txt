(#64006-ES)

Speed your Propeller 2 project development with this line of Add-on Boards, sold separately or as a set.
Each board features a 2x6 pass-through socket that is compatible with any Propeller 2 development
boards with a 2x6 accessory header.
Compatible development systems include the ​P2 Eval Board (#64000)​, and the ​P2 Edge Module
Breadboard (#64020)​ or​ ​P2 Edge Mini Breakout Board (#64019)​ with a​ ​P2 Edge Module (#P2-EC)​.
All eight boards can be connected to the P2 Eval Board at the same time as shown above, making it very
convenient to fully explore the capabilities of the Propeller 2 multicore microcontroller.
Note: It is strongly recommended to connect the auxiliary power supply to the P2-EVAL board P2-USB
socket when experimenting with the accessory boards, as power requirements may exceed what is
available from the PC-USB socket.
Except for the Mini-Prototyping board, each accessory board has a mounting hole which is connected to
GND, and is suitable for M3 (UNC 4- 40) hardware. The hole is 3.2 mm (126 mil) and the pad ring is 5
mm (200 mil). This could be used to fit a 9.5 mm long standoff to act as a leg, and provide support when
connected to the P2-EVAL board (#64000-ES).
The boards come in three sizes; refer to the PCB Dimensions drawing for details. Two small modules, or
one large and one small module, can fit side-by-side on each edge of the P2-EVAL Board.

P2 Eval Control Add-on Board (#64006A)

The Control accessory board includes four push-buttons and four blue LEDs.
The push-buttons allow simple digital input control
of other circuits or processes. Each active-high
push-button has a 470 Ω series resistor to allow the
I/O pin to be driven low while the button is
asserted.
The LEDs are active-high and positioned next to
each button. Each LED is controlled by its own
independent I/O pin for flexibility.

P2 Eval Serial Host Add-on Board (#64006B)

The Serial Host accessory board has twin USB-type A sockets, each protected with a current-limited load
switch that allows up to 500 mA continuous current, subject to overall available system power. Additional
protection includes reverse current blocking, short-circuit protection, over temperature protection and
VBUS soft start.
This accessory board allows two USB-type devices to be connected simultaneously, such as a keyboard
and mouse. Two user controlled blue activity LEDs are located beside the USB-type A socket.
To enable the Serial Host 5V power output on each channel, set the corresponding channel enable pin
high. I/O pin 1 for channel 1, and I/O pin 5 for channel 2.
Note that the Serial Host accessory board requires 5V to function.​ When used with the P2-ES
Eval Board Rev B, the shunt jumper must connect that board's ACC HDR and 5V pins to supply 5V to its
I/O Pin Breakout Edge Headers.

P
​ 2 Eval LED Matrix Add-on Board (#64006C)

This board features an 8 x 7 grid of Charlieplexed green LEDs. It can be used to display text of graphics
across 56 LEDs using only 8 I/O pins! The technique of Charlieplexing is described here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing​. Charlieplexing allows for control of more LEDs with fewer
I/O pins by taking advantage of the one-way current flow properties of diodes (including Light Emitting
Diodes), along with the tri-state properties of the Propeller 2 I/O pins.
This lookup table shows the required state of the Propeller I/O pins to illuminate each LED. For example,
to light the LED at Row 3 Col 6, the table shows 3 HIGH 0 LOW. In this case, we would set IO 3 HIGH
and IO 0 LOW to light this LED. Set both IO pins to INPUT mode to turn the LED off.

To light multiple LEDs, rely on the fast operating speed of the Propeller 2. While Charlieplexing doesn’t
actually light the LEDs simultaneously, it switches them on and off fast enough to trick the human eye
into believing they are on simultaneously.
When Propeller 2 code switches each LED on and off at least 50 times a second (50 Hz), flickering should
not be noticeable and the LEDs will appear to be permanently on. (For the Propeller 2 this switching
speed is no problem as each I/O could switch faster than 180 MHz, which is plenty of time to turn on
every LED if needed).
Each LED consumes approximately 4 mA when lit. If all the LEDs were continuously powered on, they
could consume 224 mA together. But, Charlieplexing needs only to light one LED at a time, so total
current consumption at any instant in time remains only 4 mA!

P2 Eval Digital Video Out Add-on Board (#64006D)

The Digital Video Out Accessory Board provides an HDMI-type connector which can be used for
experimenting with various video standards. The signal pins which are connected to the P2-EVAL header
are shown in this table:

Unused signal pins from the video connector are labelled on the PCB next to an unpopulated 0.1” pitch
row of 6 pads: CEC, RSVD, SCL, SDA, 5V▶, HPD.
Beside the 5V▶ output pad is another pad labelled “ACC 5V”. That is the 5V supply from the accessory
socket. Some video monitors require a 5V signal connecting to the 5V▶ pin, so these two pads with 0.1”
spacing make that convenient. For example, a 0.1” pitch header could be soldered here, and a shunt plug
used when 5V is required to the monitor.

P2 Eval Mini Prototyping Add-on Board (#64006E)

The Mini Prototyping Add-on Board provides an 8x12 grid of plated thru-holes.
Ground holes are connected on both sides of the PCB, and marked on the top side by white silk blocks.
Other holes that are joined are marked on the top side of the PCB with silk dashes or boxes. And they are
linked on the bottom of the PCB with copper traces that are isolated clearly to enable easy cutting as
required.
Holes inside a white box are joined to the signal or power marked. Referring to the image, 5V, VIO and
the I/O pins 0 thru 7 are highlighted with arrows. Holes joined by dashes are joined together, but are not
joined to any signal. Referring to the image, these holes are highlighted with an orange box.
There is one exposed ground strip on the bottom of the PCB (marked in orange below) to allow easy
bridging of the neighboring thru-holes to Ground.

P2 Eval Serial Device Add-on Board (#64006F)

The Serial Device accessory board has two microUSB-type sockets, each with two activity LEDs.
This accessory board allows the Propeller 2 to behave as up to two USB-type devices, connecting to a
