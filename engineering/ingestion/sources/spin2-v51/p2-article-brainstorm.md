## üì∞ HERO ARTICLES (Cross-Audience Appeal)

### 1. "The Death of RTOS: How 8 Hardware Cores Change Everything"
**Angle**: Why manage tasks in software when you have 8 actual processors?
**Key Points**:
- No scheduler overhead
- No priority inversions
- No mutex hell
- Each peripheral gets its own CPU
- Deterministic by default
**Hook**: "We spent 40 years building better schedulers. What if we just didn't need them?"

### 2. "Your Variables Are Already In Registers: The Spin2 Magic Trick"
**Angle**: The revolutionary inline assembly that auto-syncs variables
**Demo**: Show the SAME code in C (complex) vs Spin2 (simple)
**Mind-blower**: "What if I told you your local variables are already IN the CPU registers?"

### 3. "Built-In Oscilloscope: Debug Like It's 2025"
**Angle**: DEBUG isn't printf - it's a complete instrument suite
**Visual**: Screenshots of live waveforms from actual code
**Tag line**: "Stop buying $5000 logic analyzers. It's already in your chip."

## üîß ARM DEVELOPER FOCUSED

### "Escape from Interrupt Hell: The P2 Way"
**Their Pain**: Nested interrupts, priority management, ISR restrictions
**P2 Solution**: 
- Give interrupts their own core
- No nesting needed - parallel execution
- Interrupts that persist across language modes
**Code Example**: ARM's 50-line interrupt setup vs P2's 5-line REGEXEC

### "No Cache, No Problem: When Every Core Has Local RAM"
**Their Pain**: Cache coherency, DMA vs cache, performance tuning
**P2 Solution**:
- Each cog has private 2KB
- No cache coherency issues
- Deterministic access times
- LUT sharing between pairs for fast inter-core

### "DMA Is Dead, Long Live Smart Pins"
**Their Pain**: Complex DMA setup, channels, priorities
**P2 Solution**:
- 64 Smart Pins handle I/O independently
- No DMA needed - pins are smart
- Each pin is a state machine

## ü•ß RASPBERRY PI DEVELOPER FOCUSED

### "Real-Time Pi: What If Linux Wasn't In The Way?"
**Their Pain**: Can't bit-bang protocols, OS jitter, kernel delays
**P2 Solution**:
- Bare metal with high-level language
- Microsecond precision without kernel
- 8 cores without Linux overhead
**Demo**: Perfect WS2812 timing, impossible on Pi

### "The 40-Pin Alternative: P2 vs Pi GPIO"
**Comparison Table**:
- Pi: Shared GPIO, kernel access, ~1MHz max
- P2: 64 Smart Pins, direct access, 250MHz
**Killer Line**: "Every pin is smarter than Arduino's entire processor"

### "Headless From Birth: When You Don't Need An OS"
**Angle**: Purpose-built for embedded, not stripped-down desktop
**Benefits**:
- Boots in microseconds
- No SD card corruption
- No apt-get update
- Power on = running

## üéÆ ARDUINO DEVELOPER FOCUSED

### "Arduino√ó8: Your First Multi-Core Experience"
**Angle**: Natural progression from Arduino
**Structure**:
- Start with familiar (one cog, similar syntax)
- Add second cog (mind blown)
- Show 8-cog symphony
**Tag**: "Remember loop()? Now you can have 8 of them."

### "From pinMode to Smart Pins: The Evolution"
**Their Pain**: Software PWM, timing issues, interrupt conflicts
**P2 Solution**:
- Hardware PWM on every pin
- Hardware serial on every pin
- Hardware quadrature on every pin
**Demo**: 64 simultaneous PWM channels

### "Debug Without Serial.print: Welcome to the Future"
**Show Don't Tell**:
```spin2
DEBUG(`SCOPE mySignal)     // Live oscilloscope!
DEBUG(`LOGIC pins)         // Logic analyzer!
DEBUG(`TERM "Value: ", DEC value)  // Terminal too
```
**Angle**: "What if debugging was actually... fun?"
