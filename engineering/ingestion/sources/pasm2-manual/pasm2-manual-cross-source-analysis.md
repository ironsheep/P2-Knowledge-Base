## 🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: DOCX EXTRACTION IS MASSIVE

### Fidelity Comparison
| Source | Paragraphs | Tables | Code Examples | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **DOCX Extraction** | **10,771** | **219** | **362** | 🟢 RICH |
| PDF Extraction | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | ⚠️ CHECK |

**DOCX appears to be the authoritative source with ~45% instruction coverage!**

## 📊 Source Contribution Summary

### Primary Value
- **219 instruction tables** (likely ~45% of 491 instructions)
- **362 code examples** showing usage patterns
- **739 instruction-specific paragraphs**
- **Massive 10,771 total paragraphs** of content
- **November 2022 version** - Recent

### Coverage Assessment
- **45% Potential** - If 219 tables = 219 instructions documented
- **Trust Level**: 🟡 YELLOW - Draft but substantial
- **Fidelity**: DOCX extraction appears far superior to any PDF version

## 🎯 Trust Zone Assessment
*From central-analysis/cross-source-qa/conflicts-and-trust-zones.md*

### Trust Level: 🟡 YELLOW (HIGH for documented portions)
- **Author**: Parallax documentation team
- **Status**: PRELIMINARY/DRAFT
- **Coverage**: ~45% of instructions
- **Quality**: High for what's documented
- **Validation**: Examples appear tested

### No Conflicts Expected
- ✅ Should align with Silicon Doc encoding
- ✅ Should match PASM2 spreadsheet opcodes

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ACTIONS NEEDED

### 1. Immediate Verification
- Compare DOCX vs PDF extraction fidelity
- Identify which 219 instructions are documented
- Extract instruction list from tables
- Update instruction completion matrix

### 2. Extraction Quality Check
- Verify tables extracted correctly
- Ensure code examples preserved
- Check for formatting loss

### 3. Multiple Documents to Consolidate
- `PASM2-MANUAL-EXTRACTION-AUDIT.md` - Older format
- `pasm2-manual-complete-extraction-audit.md` - Main audit
- `pasm2-manual-docx-extraction.md` - DOCX specific (KEEP!)

- Gaps potentially filled: Major instruction documentation gap
- Trust level: YELLOW but valuable
- Fidelity: DOCX >> PDF (10,771 paragraphs!)

### Cross-Source Value
- **Could fill 45%** of instruction documentation gap
- **Changes landscape** of PASM2 knowledge
- **Essential for**: Code generation
- **Game changer**: If tables = instructions

## 🔴 URGENT RECOMMENDATION

**This DOCX extraction could be the most valuable discovery in the ingestion!**

1. **PRIORITIZE** analyzing the 219 tables
2. **EXTRACT** instruction names from tables
3. **UPDATE** instruction completion matrix immediately
4. **PRESERVE** DOCX extraction at all costs
5. **NEVER** replace with PDF if less rich
