# PASM2 Manual Extraction Audit - What We ACTUALLY Have

## Critical Missing Elements You Identified

### 1. Clock Timing Information (Rightmost Column)
**STATUS: MISSED** ❌
- The PASM2 manual tables have a rightmost column with exact clock cycles
- This is CRITICAL for performance optimization and consulting
- We extracted narrative descriptions but NOT the timing column data

### 2. Instruction Narratives from Tables
**STATUS: PARTIALLY EXTRACTED** ⚠️
- We claim 315 instructions documented
- But audit shows 219 tables extracted
- Discrepancy suggests incomplete extraction

## What We Need to Verify

### Instruction Coverage Audit Required

I need you to visually compare:

**From PASM2 Manual Tables, we found these instruction groups:**

#### Tables We THINK We Extracted (Need Verification):
1. **ABS** - Absolute value
2. **ADD/ADDS/ADDX** - Addition variants
3. **ADDCT1/2/3** - Add to event timers
4. **ADDPIX** - Add pixels
5. **ADDS/ADDSX** - Signed addition
6. **AKPIN** - Acknowledge smart pin
7. **ALTB/ALTD/ALTGB/ALTGN/ALTGW** - ALT instruction family
8. **ALTI/ALTR/ALTS/ALTSB/ALTSN/ALTSW** - More ALT variants
9. **AND/ANDN** - Logical AND operations
10. **AUGD/AUGS** - Augment operations
11. **BITC/BITH/BITL/BITNC/BITNOT/BITNZ/BITRND/BITZ** - Bit operations
12. **BLNPIX/BMASK** - Pixel and mask operations
13. **BRK** - Break operation
14. **CALL/CALLA/CALLB/CALLD** - Call variants
15. **CMP/CMPM/CMPR/CMPS/CMPSX/CMPX** - Compare operations
16. **COGATN/COGBRK/COGID/COGINIT/COGSTOP** - COG control
17. **CRCBIT/CRCNIB** - CRC operations
18. **DECMOD/DECOD** - Decode operations
19. **DIR*/DRV*/FLT*/OUT*** - Pin control (multiple tables)
20. **DJF/DJNF/DJNZ/DJZ** - Decrement and jump
21. **ENCOD** - Encode operation
22. **EXECF** - Execute from FIFO
23. **FBLOCK/FLTL/FLTH** - FIFO and float operations
24. **GETBRK/GETBYTE/GETCT/GETNIB** - Get operations
25. **GETPTR/GETQX/GETQY/GETRND** - More get operations
26. **GETSCP/GETWORD/GETXACC** - Additional get operations
27. **HUBSET** - Hub configuration
28. **INCMOD** - Increment modulo
29. **IJMP*/IJNZ/IJZ** - Indirect jumps
30. **JMP/JMPREL** - Jump operations

[... continues for all 219 tables ...]

### What's Missing from Our Extraction:

#### Critical Data NOT Extracted:
1. **Clock Cycle Timing** (rightmost column of every instruction table)
   - Example: "2 clocks" or "2..9 clocks" or "hub-dependent"
   - This is ESSENTIAL for performance consulting

2. **Complete Instruction Narratives** 
   - We may have missed tail-end instructions
   - Need to verify all 219 tables were fully extracted

3. **Encoding Details**
   - Some tables have encoding patterns we may have missed

## Verification Checklist for Visual Audit

Please check the PASM2 manual for:

### Table Structure Verification
Each instruction table should have:
- [ ] Instruction name/mnemonic
- [ ] Syntax column
- [ ] Encoding column (EEEE OOOOOOO CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS)
- [ ] Description/narrative
- [ ] **Clock timing column (rightmost)** ← WE MISSED THIS
- [ ] Flag effects (C/Z)

### Specific Instructions to Spot-Check
Look for these potentially missed instructions at document tail:
- XORO32, XSTOP, XZERO
- WAITX, WAITXFI, WAITXRO
- WRFAST, WRLUT, WRLONG, WRPIN, WRWORD
- ZEROX
- Any others after 'W' alphabetically

### Clock Timing Examples to Find
Look for timing patterns like:
- "2 clocks"
- "2..9 clocks" 
- "hub-dependent"
- "CORDIC-dependent"
- "2 + hub window"

## Why This Matters

### Clock Timing Impact:
- **Performance optimization** - Know which instructions are fast/slow
- **Real-time guarantees** - Calculate exact execution time
- **Power optimization** - Understand power consumption patterns
- **Consulting value** - "Use X instead of Y for 3x speedup"

### Complete Narrative Impact:
- **Architectural understanding** - WHEN and WHY to use instructions
- **Pattern recognition** - Common instruction sequences
- **Trust elevation** - Move from yellow to green status

## Recommended Re-Extraction Focus

1. **Priority 1**: Extract clock timing column from ALL instruction tables
2. **Priority 2**: Verify all 219 tables fully extracted (especially tail)
3. **Priority 3**: Extract any missing instruction narratives
4. **Priority 4**: Capture encoding patterns we missed

## Questions for Visual Verification

1. How many instruction tables are actually in the PASM2 manual?
2. Do ALL tables have the clock timing column?
3. Which instructions appear AFTER 'W' alphabetically?
4. Are there multi-page tables we only partially extracted?
5. Any tables in appendices we missed?
