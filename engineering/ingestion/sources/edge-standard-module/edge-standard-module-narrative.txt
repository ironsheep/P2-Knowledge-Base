P2 Edge Module Rev D (#P2-EC)

The P2 Edge Module is a simple way to get started with the Propeller 2 multicore
microcontroller. In addition to speeding development, this module provides an optimal P2
building block for system integrators and designers to include in their products.
The Propeller 2 P2X8C4M64P chip contains over 32 million transistors and >70 mm2 of custom
silicon, 10x that of a typical microcontroller. The P2 is an 8-core 32 bit CPU with 32-bit timers, 64
-bit CORDIC math solver, and custom analog pad rings with Smart-pin functionality at all 64 I/O
pins. Each smart I/O pin is capable of many autonomous analog and digital functions, including
ADC, DAC, PWM, USB, SERIAL, Waveform generation, SMPS, Comparator, SCHMITT and LOGIC
modes.
The P2 Edge Module includes the exposed-pad 100-pin TQFP P2X8C4M64P, core and I/O power
regulators, power filtering capacitors, crystal, flash memory, boot configuration switches, and
two user-configurable on-board LEDs to indicate system states. Rev C of the Edge module adds
an SD Card socket and accepts a wide power supply range. The PCB's multi-layer design features
solid thermal and signal reference planes isolating each signal layer. The design is optimized for
low-noise analog and digital operation, and with low temperature rise even at high-speed
operation.
For development, the P2 Edge Module fits in the card edge socket of the spacious P2 Edge
Module Breadboard, the compact P2 Edge Mini Breakout Board, or the bare-bones P2 Edge
80-pin Adapter Kit. For product integration, several edge socket choices are available. This
arrangement allows developers to integrate the Propeller 2 into products without the need for
multi-layer cost or expertise. See the Propeller 2 section of www.parallax.com for options.
The following features and specifications apply to the P2-EC3 Rev D; changes denoted with an
asterisk. See the Revision History at the end of the document for additional details.

2. VDD and Edge-VIN Power Supplies with Reverse Polarity Input Protection
The VDD power supply is for the Propeller 2 core. This onboard power supply is based on a
switching buck regulator, capable of delivering 3 A at 1.8 V. Short circuit, over-current,
reverse-input polarity and brownout detection are also included.
VDD is typically expected to be 1.8 V. This voltage powers the internal circuits of the P2
microcontroller. In case of a prolonged short-circuit the VDD regulator will shut down for 20ms,
then attempt to restart for 2.5ms. If the short-circuit remains the regulator will shut down again
and repeat the cycle until the short-circuit has been remedied.
The VDD power supply includes brown-out detection, which will keep the P2 in reset while VDD
is below approximately 1.5V.
Alongside the VDD power supply is an additional 3 A switcher that provides conditioned voltage
to the LDO 3.3V VIO regulators. This allows the Edge module to support a wider power supply
input voltage range of 5-16 VDC, and ensures the LDO regulators are operating at maximum
efficiency with minimal heat dissipation.
3. LDO regulators for I/O Pin Voltage
The 8 LDO regulators are fixed 3.3 V low-noise regulators, which power the P2 I/O smart-pins.
Each regulator has short-circuit and over-current protection. You may see this voltage referred
to as VIO (Voltage for IO), or by group of I/O pins in the format Vxxxx or Vxx.
At the actual microcontroller, the Propeller 2 Smart I/O pins are grouped such that each 4 I/O’s
have a dedicated voltage supply connection. If you refer to the diagram Propeller 2 Physical Pins
you will see the voltage supply connections labeled as V0003, V0407, V0811, etc.
This allows pins that will be performing sensitive analog functions to use dedicated quiet, local
3.3 V regulation.
With the P2 Edge Module, the voltage supply connections have been brought out in groups of 8
I/O pins each. Each group has a dedicated LDO regulator with the VIO output labeled Vxx at the
edge connector. The two digits after the V refer to the first of 8 I/O pins that the LDO provides
power to. For example, V08 would mean VIO voltage for I/O pins 8 to 15.
Note: While it would be possible (and typical) to have a single larger regulator to power all the
3.3 V I/O supplies, the distributed LDOs allow for better local regulation, higher current and
isolation per I/O group, low noise, improved protection, less voltage drop under load, and
better thermal characteristics. The distributed power scheme is not a requirement of the P2
microprocessor; rather a design choice for this particular module.

4. TXCO Oscillator
The P2 Edge Module is equipped with a high-precision 20 MHz temperature-compensated
crystal oscillator. Operational frequency is adjustable; for full operating frequency configuration
details, options, and limits, refer to the Propeller 2 documentation at www.parallax.com.
The Propeller 2's on-chip crystal oscillator with internal 9 pF load capacitance drives the 20 MHz
crystal to provide a base clock frequency for the Propeller 2. The actual operating frequency is
selected in code, and can be almost any value or fractional value by using three special multiply
and divide registers.
Overclocking

The clock frequency of Propeller 2 is defined by user code. It can be adjusted very precisely
using three multiply and divide registers that set the actual operating frequency based on a
function of the crystal oscillator frequency. The nominal maximum is 180 MHz, though many
early users have been running the Propeller 2 overclocked at 320 MHz. Advice about
overclocking can be found at https://forums.parallax.com.
5. Flash Memory
The flash memory can be used to store user code or data, and is selectable as the prefered Boot
device, See the Boot Mode Selection section for the necessary switch settings.
The device uses SPI protocol, with 16 MB (128 Mbit) capacity. Refer to the W25Q128JVSIM
manufacturer datasheet for full details.
6. Mode Selection Switch Bank
This bank of dip switches controls the LED power and Boot Mode Selection functions. The dip
switches are not set to any particular state on a new Edge module, although the four switches
will all usually be set to the OFF position.
LED Power Control (On board LEDs enable)

This switch controls power to two onboard LEDs, labeled and connected to I/Os P56 and P57.
Switch ON to enable the LEDs. Switch OFF to disable the LEDs.
Boot Mode Selection

Upon startup or after reset, the Propeller 2 will always proceed according to the boot mode
selection table shown below. The three switches labeled Flash, △ and ▽ are used to select the
Boot Mode, and the options include booting (loading code) from USB-Serial, SD card or SPI
Flash memory.

Tip: △ and ▽ are both connected to the Propeller 2 I/O pin P59; one with a pull-up resistor to
3.3V, and the other with a pull-down resistor to GND. You may see these boot mode selection
pins referred to in other documentation as P59 up and P59 down.
Important! To avoid inconsistent behavior, only switch one of the △ or ▽ dip-switches ON.

7. LED Buffer
The LED buffer is a dual Schmitt-trigger buffer that has high impedance connections to the P2
microprocessor I/Os P56 and P57, and drives the corresponding status LED ON when the P2 I/O
signal line is high.
All I/O signals from the P2 microcontroller are high impedance by default, which means the
LEDs will be sensitive to objects moving close to the edge connector P56 and P57 pins. This
design choice means that those 2 I/O pins are not impacted by the presence of the LEDs or
external pull-up resistors by default, and are completely flexible and free for the user to use as
required.
In user code those pins could be driven high or low, or have I/O pin pull-ups activated, to control
the LEDs without the high-impedance behavior.
If the LEDs are not required, the P2 Edge Module dip-switch marked “LED” could be switched
“OFF” to disable LED power.

8. LEDs P56 and P57
These two LEDs are mounted so that they are visible from both sides of the P2 Edge Module
PCB. They are connected via an LED Buffer to pins P56 and P57. The buffer isolates the LEDs so
they will not influence the I/O signals.
If the LEDs are not required, the P2 Edge Module dip-switch marked “LED” could be switched
“OFF” to disable LED power.
9. Mounting Holes
The two plated mounting holes are attached to the ground plane. See the PCB Dimensions
section for mounting hole spacing.
10. Orientation Hole
The single unplated orientation hole could be used by a customer application to fix the module
in-place or ensure correct orientation. See the PCB Dimensions section for the hole position and
dimensions.
11. Edge connector
The 0.05” (1.27 mm) pitch 8- way edge connector extends on both sides of the module, with 40
connections on each side. Refer to Edge Connector Pin Assignment for full details.
Suitable connectors are available from the Parallax webshop:
● Card Edge Socket, Through Hole, Right Angle (#450-00308)
● Card Edge Socket, Straight, SMT (#450-00309)
● Card Edge Socket, Straight, Through Hole (#450-00310)
12. microSD card socket
The Rev C Edge Module adds a microSD socket. Your compatible removable microSD cards can
store code which is run by the P2 when it starts up, provided the proper Boot Mode is selected.
The same card can also be used to store (read or write) user data during run time. Uses include
accessing large lookup tables, playing audio files, and data logging.
Power for the microSD card socket is supplied by the VIO5663 LDO regulator, and the socket is
hardwired to four Propeller 2 I/O pins:
