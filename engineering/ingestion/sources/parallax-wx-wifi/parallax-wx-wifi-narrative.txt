Parallax WX ESP8266 Wi-Fi Modules
DIP (#32420D), or SIP (#32420S)
The Parallax WX Wi-Fi module offers a new way to add Wi-Fi connectivity to your your
microcontroller projects. It can function as its own wireless access point (AP) or as a station
(STA) on another Wi-Fi network, or even both for brief periods of time when joining another
network. In either mode, it can serve its own configuration pages as well as user-created web
pages that make it possible for devices to interact with a microcontroller through the Wi-Fi
module. On Wi-Fi networks configured to allow it to access the Internet, it can also send and
receive a variety TCP/IP messages for Internet of Things (IoT) projects. This module also
serves its own firmware upgrade page that allows you to pick and upload the latest open source
firmware revision, or even variations that support specific applications as they become
available.

Supports 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi access through the ESP8266-WROOM-02 module (FCC and
CE approved)
Transparent serial communication mode for wireless microcontroller programming and
debugging (Activity Board WX)
Command serial communication mode for exchanging information with the host
microcontroller
3 Wi-Fi modes: (AP) as access point that up to four devices can join, (STA) as a station
on another Wi-Fi network, and (STA + AP) station plus access point for joining another
Wi-Fi network.
Micro web server allows other devices to access both configuration and user
created/uploaded web pages in STA or AP mode.
Approximately 1 MB of user file system for storing web pages and other content.
Built-in configuration web pages for settings, networks, file uploads and over the air
firmware updates.
Over the air (OTA) web page uploads via a simple web interface. Upload one or more
pages to the module’s user file system. The Wi-Fi module will serve those pages to
computers and mobile devices that have joined its network (AP) or on the same network
with it (STA). This will allow your microcontroller projects to interact with computers,
tablets, cell phones, and other devices on the network.
OTA firmware upgrades, also through a simple web interface. With this, your Wi-Fi
module can always be ready for latest features and projects contributed by Parallax and
the open source community.
Supports HTTP (server), WebSocket (server), and TCP (client) connections.
HTTP/WebSocket allows your Wi-Fi module to exchange data with other devices on the
network through user-created web pages it serves. TCP enables connection to other
devices for low-level communication, for example to build your own HTTP request to a
page on the worldwide web.

Application Ideas
Set up your own pages for controlling and
monitoring your robot or sensor projects. The
module hosts and serves the pages over Wi-Fi
and then acts as a simple serial intermediary
between your microcontroller and HTTP or
WebSocket clients accessing pages. Picture a
Boe-Bot Robot reporting its Ping))) distance
measurements and receiving control commands
from a web page on a cell phone.’

Program the Propeller Activity Board WX
over Wi-Fi with the DIP module, and see its
remote sensor data display on your computer
in real time. This is especially useful when
preparing for robot contests because your
ActivityBot can roam in a maze and transmit
sensor data to the SimpleIDE Terminal
without the USB tether. Reprogram it without
ever removing it from the maze!
Program your microcontroller to make TCP
client connections with web pages on the
Internet to get key pieces of information for
your project. Send messages to pages
hosted by services that can trigger emails,
Twitter feeds, and more.

Functional Description

(1) ESP8266-WROOM-02 Wi-Fi Module
The ESP-WROOM-02 is a low-power 32-bit MCU Wi-Fi module based on an ESP8266 chip,
embedded with TCP/IP network stacks, integrated with 16 Mbits of SPI flash, and capable of
operating in low power connectivity modes such as DTIM10 at 1.2mW. ESP-WROOM-02 is
FCC, CE, KCC, TELEC, LCIE and IC certified with the best FCC results for IoT modules in the
industry.
(2) WX compatible headers
The DIP version plugs straight into the Propeller Activity Board WX 2 x 10 x 2mm socket.
(3) Linear 3.3V regulator
The linear 3.3V LDO regulator provides power to the ESP8266 microcontroller, and is used to
set the logic level voltage at the WX IO ports.

(4) Reverse Polarity Protection
When the module is powered by the optional SIP (Breadboard) header, a P-Channel mosfet
provides reverse polarity protection and almost zero voltage drop at VIN.
(5) Power LED
The power LED remains on whilst correct polarity voltage is supplied to either the WX/XBee
socket, or the SIP (Breadboard) connector. LED’s are visible from both sides of the board.
(6) ASC “Associate” LED
In the description, bold is the wireless mode, small text indicates connectivity or lack thereof,
and after hyphen (-) indicates LED behavior and the timing.

STA+AP (has IP on STA and AP) [Wirelessly accessible]* - OFF 2000 ms, ON 25 ms,
OFF 150 ms, ON 2000 ms
STA (has IP address) [Wirelessly accessible] - OFF 4000 ms, ON 25 ms
STA (no IP address) [Not wirelessly accessible] - OFF constantly

(7) DI “Data-In” LED
The data-in LED will blink whilst serial data is being received by the module at either the WX
header, or the SIP header. LED’s are visible from both sides of the board.
(8) DO “Data-Out” LED
The data-out LED will blink whilst serial data is being transmitted by the module at either the WX
header, or the SIP header. LED’s are visible from both sides of the board.
(9) Level shifters and buffers
To ensure maximum compatibility with a wide range of 3.3V and 5V microcontrollers and
development boards, the Parallax Wi-Fi module includes voltage level shifters and buffers to
ensure that the logic voltage levels at the SIP header are set by the VIN voltage level. If you
supply 3.3V to VIN, then the IO pins logic voltage level will be 3.3V. If you supply 5V to VIN,
then the IO pins logic voltage level will be 5V.
(10) SIP “Breadboard” header
The right-angled SIP header is a standard 0.1” spaced male header, suitable for plugging
directly into a breadboard, or will accept a wide range of header cables (eg. 800-00048,
751-00010). The four pins starting GND, RES, DI, DO are also compatible with the Parallax
Prop Plug (#32201) for easy firmware re-programming and development.

Configuration Pages
The Parallax WX Wi-Fi module comes pre-configured as a wireless access point (AP mode). To
join its network, find the access point that starts with wx- followed by 6 alphanumeric characters.

Later, if you have configured your Wi-Fi module to reside on another network, you can make it
reappear as an access point by rapidly grounding and releasing the /PGM pin four times. If your
Wi-Fi module is in an Activity Board WX, this can be done by pressing and releasing the RST
button rapidly, four times. In a breadboard, a pushbutton with one terminal connected to GND
and the other to /PGM is convenient.
After your device (computer, phone, or tablet) has joined the Wi-Fi module’s network, you can
go to its Configuration home page by navigating to http://192.168.4.1.

The Configuration home page has 4 sub-pages (try Chrome if your browser doesn’t support all
of the features listed)
● Networks: For setting the network mode and joining another network.
● Files: For uploading web pages and other files for interacting with
microcontroller/electronic/robotic applications. The pages can be accessed later through
a computer or portable device.
● Settings: For defining the the module’s name and serial communication settings for data
exchange with the host microcontroller.
● Firmware: For updating the firmware with newer releases that will be made available
through the Wi-Fi module product page at www.parallax.com.
To make the Wi-Fi module join another network, click the networks tab. Then, set the Wi-Fi
mode to STA+AP. A network list should appear after a brief wait. To join the network, click the
radio button next to the network, enter a password (if needed) and then click the Connect
button.

1. IMMEDIATELY​ make a note of the IP address the network assigned to your module.
2. IMMEDIATELY GO BACK TO THE NETWORKS PAGE AND SET THE Wi-Fi MODE
TO STA.​ Leaving it in STA+AP mode could introduce a security vulnerability to the
network the Wi-Fi module joins. In this example, it’s 10.10.11.145, and in station mode,
that should be used in place of 192.168.4.1, which works in AP mode.

The Files page makes it easy to upload custom web pages and other files that the wi-Fi module
can serve. Just click the Choose File button, browse to the file you want to upload, and then
double-click it. Tutorials for writing web pages that interact with your microcontroller through the
Wi-Fi module are available, and example files are in a subfolder of the firmware zip file, both of
which are available from the 32420S and 32420D product pages from w
​ ww.parallax.com/​.

Assuming the file you uploaded is named web-page.html, you’ll be able to access it at
http://192.168.4.1/files/web-page.html in AP mode, or
http://TheIpAddressYouNoted/files/web-page.html in STA mode.
It’s fine to repeatedly change a file and re-upload it. The system will always serve the most
recently uploaded version of a file if more than one version has been uploaded. There is almost
1 MB of file storage. The first version of this firmware does not feature a full file manager, but
with 1 MB of storage and the ability to repeatedly upload any modifications to a file, even under
the same name will support most prototyping endeavors. The Empty can also be used to clear
the file system, and then files can be re-uploaded.
The Settings page has a module name field, which can be used to give the module a custom
and more recognizable name. The other settings pertain to serial communication and will vary
by microcontroller host, and in some cases by application as well. The default settings are
recommended for use with the Propeller Microcontroller in the Propeller Activity Board. These
settings make it possible to also load programs from a computer into a Propeller in an Activity
Board WX through the Wi-Fi module. Settings for the BASIC Stamp 2 are listed in the Getting
Started Guide for that microcontroller, linked under the Additional Resources tab on the 32420S
product page at www.parallax.com.

The Parallax Wi-Fi module is designed to support over the air (OTA) firmware upgrades. So
let’s say you purchased the Wi-Fi module, and some time later, the firmware gets upgraded by
Parallax or its community to support more cool applications. If you want your Wi-Fi module to
support those applications too, all you have to do is download the firmware from the Parallax
web site, unzip it, and then use this page to choose the file (with a .ota extension) and load it
into the Wi-Fi module.
