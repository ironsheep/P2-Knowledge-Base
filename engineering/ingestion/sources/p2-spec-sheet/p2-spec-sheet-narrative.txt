Propeller P2X8C4M64P (P2) Multicore Microcontroller Spec Sheet
The Propeller P2X8C4M64P (P2) is a multicore microcontroller with the performance of an MPU, excelling at
real-time analog and digital applications. Designed to help engineers achieve the fastest time to market, the P2's
highly flexible, deterministic hardware and development environment are free from the complication, expense and
lead time associated with traditional FPGA-type development cycles.
The P2 has 8 identical 32-bit processors each with 4 KB of dual-port RAM, a configurable clock up to 320 MHz
(8x160 MIPs), 64 smart I/O pins, and a common hub with 512 KB of shared RAM and a CORDIC math solver.
Each of the 64 smart I/Os can be accessed by every cog, and are independently able to execute hundreds of
autonomous analog and digital functions. Each Smart Pin can support almost any protocol, with a growing list of
objects including 1-WIRE, CANbus, DVI, HDMI, HDTV, HUB75, HyperFlash/RAM, I²C, QSPI/QSSI, RS485, SCI/SPI, SID,
SD CARD, UART/USART, USB 2.0 HOST/SLAVE, VGA, XBEE. (For R&D only; end users must seek their own protocol
licenses where needed.)
External Flash or a removable SD card memory can be used to boot or store program code and data, which allows
for simple product deployment, on-site updates and efficient, low-cost support.
