## üìä Style Analysis Framework

### Level 1: Document Architecture
- **Overall Structure**: Marketing overview ‚Üí Selected specs ‚Üí Feature highlights
- **Section Hierarchy**: Flat, single-page design with visual sections
- **Flow Pattern**: Scannable format, designed for quick assessment
- **Navigation Aids**: Visual separation with headers, minimal depth

### Level 2: Content Patterns
- **Information Density**: Moderate - balanced between detail and accessibility
- **Example Strategy**: Protocol examples, application mentions, no code
- **Visual Elements**: Bulleted lists dominate, minimal tables
- **Progressive Disclosure**: None - all information at same level

### Level 3: Voice & Tone
- **Perspective**: Third person with slight marketing tone
- **Formality Level**: 7/10 - Professional but more accessible than datasheet
- **Audience Assumptions**: Technical decision makers, not necessarily deep engineers
- **Instruction Style**: Capability-focused, emphasizing possibilities

### Level 4: Micro-patterns
- **Sentence Structure**: Mixed length, some marketing phrases
- **Terminology Usage**: Technical terms with context clues
- **Emphasis Techniques**: 
  - Bold for product name
  - Bullets for all specifications
  - Grouped feature lists
- **Warning/Note Style**: Parenthetical notes (e.g., "For R&D only")

## üîÑ Replication Guide

### To Write in Spec Sheet Style:

1. **Lead with value proposition**
   - 2-3 sentences positioning
   - Competitive differentiation
   - Key use cases

2. **Cherry-pick impressive specs**
   - "Selected Specifications" not complete
   - Round numbers when possible
   - Group related capabilities

3. **Emphasize breadth of features**
   - Long lists show capability
   - Name-drop protocols/standards
   - Quantity over detail

4. **Keep it scannable**
   - One page ideal
   - Bullets everywhere
   - Visual grouping

5. **Include practical info**
   - Package type
   - Temperature range
   - Compliance basics
   - Where to learn more
