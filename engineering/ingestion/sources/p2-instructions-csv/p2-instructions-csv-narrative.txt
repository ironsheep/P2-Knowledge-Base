P2 Instructions v35 - Rev B/C Silicon - Instruction Set Reference

This CSV file contains the complete PASM2 instruction set reference for the Propeller 2 microcontroller, specifically for Revision B and C silicon. It represents a comprehensive tabular listing of all assembly language instructions available on the P2 processor.

Structure and Content:
The CSV is organized with the following key columns:
- Order: Sequential instruction listing
- Assembly Syntax: Shows the instruction mnemonic and operand format, including immediate (#S, #D) and register modes
- Group: Categorizes instructions by functional area
- Encoding: Binary encoding format for the instruction
- Alias: Alternative instruction names or forms
- Description: Detailed explanation of instruction operation, including flag effects and addressing modes
- Interrupt Shielding: Indicates if the next instruction is protected from interrupts
- Clock Cycles: Multiple columns showing cycle counts for different execution modes:
  - Cog Exec Mode (8 cogs and 16 cogs)
  - LUT Exec Mode
  - Hub Exec Mode
  - Additional cycles for hub long crossings

Key Instruction Categories:
The instruction set covers all fundamental P2 operations including:
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Bit manipulation and testing
- Memory access (COG, LUT, HUB)
- Flow control and branching
- CORDIC operations
- Smart pin control
- Event handling
- Streamer operations
- Special purpose instructions

Notation Conventions:
- S = source operand (register or immediate)
- D = destination operand (register or immediate)
- #S = immediate source value (when I=1)
- #D = immediate destination value (when L=1)
- Z flag = zero result indicator
- C flag = carry/borrow indicator
- WZ/WC = write zero/carry flag modifiers
- PC = program counter adjustments for branches

Execution Timing:
The CSV provides detailed timing information critical for real-time applications:
- Base instruction cycles vary by execution mode
- Hub operations may add cycles for synchronization
- LUT and COG execution have predictable timing
- Hub execution timing depends on hub window alignment

This reference is essential for:
- Assembly language programmers
- Compiler developers
- Performance optimization
- Understanding P2 architecture capabilities
- Instruction encoding for tools and debuggers

Version Information:
- Version 35 of the instruction set
- Applies to Rev B and Rev C silicon
- Represents the production instruction set
- Contains all documented PASM2 instructions

The CSV format allows for programmatic parsing and integration into development tools, documentation generators, and instruction set simulators. Each row represents a complete instruction definition with all necessary information for both manual programming and automated tool development.
