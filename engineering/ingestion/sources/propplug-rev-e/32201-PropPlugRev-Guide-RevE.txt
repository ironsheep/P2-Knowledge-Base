Prop Plug (#32201) Rev E

The Prop Plug provides a USB-to-serial port connection that is convenient for microcontroller
programming and communication.
This latest revision of Prop Plug adds pin labelling to both sides of the board, uses 2-sided LEDs
which are visible from both sides of the board, and introduces buffered inputs and outputs to
improve isolation between the Prop Plug and target board when either is powered down.
This tiny device is capable of asynchronous communication at up to 3 M baud with both 3.3-volt
and 5.0-volt devices such as the Propeller 1 and BASIC Stamp.
The Prop Plug slips onto a 4-pin, 0.1" spaced male header, providing in-system programming of
Propeller circuits in breadboard, perf board and permanent projects which have the four-pin
header.
The Prop Plug includes circuitry to generate a short pulse when the USB DTR signal is toggled
from low to high. The pulse length can vary based on the target circuit; typically 15–25 µs.
The Prop Plug Rev E uses the FTDI FT231X USB bridge IC and thus requires FTDI USB drivers.
USB A to micro-B cable required, not included, such as Parallax #805-00016.

PC Drivers Installation
Should your system require FTDI USB drivers they may be obtained from here:
https://www.parallax.com/usbdrivers​.
That page includes downloads and instructions for Windows driver installation, as well as a link
to the Mac drivers page. F
​ or macOS 10.15 "Catalina" (and later) no installation is necessary;
drivers are included in the operating system.
Note that Parallax Inc. software which relies on the FTDI drivers will normally install them
automatically.

Customer Reset Option
The Prop Plug is supplied with the serial DTR signal connected
to control the reset pulse at the RES output on the four way
header. This is the same as for all previous Prop Plug versions.
Starting with RevE there is an option pad arranged for
customers that require either an RTS controlled reset pulse, or
no reset pulse. We have added a white silk area that is suitable for marking with a permanent
marker, for customers that might have several Prop Plug units configured for different uses.

For DTR controller reset, keep the component to the left, connecting RES and DTR.
For RTS controller reset, move the component to the right, connecting RES and RTS.
For no reset pulse, remove the component.
