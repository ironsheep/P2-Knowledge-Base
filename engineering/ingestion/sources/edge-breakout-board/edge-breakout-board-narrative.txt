P2 Edge Breakout Board (#64029)
The P2 Edge Breakout Board provides a compact interface to the P2 Edge Module
for experimenting and developing with the Propeller 2 microcontroller.
The board accepts the P2 Edge Module (#P2-EC) and includes a supply voltage DC
Jack socket, power headers, Parallax Prop Plug (#32201) programming header, and
reset button.
All 64 of the P2 Edge Smart I/O pins are available at eight 0.1” pin header sockets,
compatible with both single and dual header Propeller 2 accessories. All accessory
headers are arranged to accept single or dual P2 accessory boards. The last header
includes the programming and memory pins (58-63) and reset signal (RES) for
wireless programming when using the P2 WX Adapter (#64007) with Parallax WX
ESP8266 SIP module (#32420S).

Orientation
When connecting your P2 Edge Module to the P2 Edge Breakout Board, ensure that the module is
inserted with the orientation hole on the module closest to the white orientation circle that is marked on
the breakout PCB, close to the bottom-left side of the Edge Socket. Correct module orientation is shown
in this image:

Feature Descriptions
Read the full explanation of each labeled feature on the pages that follow this diagram.

1. Parallax P2 Edge Module Socket
The P2 Edge Module socket is a 0.05 in (1.27 mm) pitch, 80-way vertical socket. Refer to Edge Connector
Pin Assignments in the P2 Edge Module product guide for full details.
The P2 Edge Module must be inserted with its orientation hole closest to the RESET Button, and aligned
with the white orientation ring that is marked on the breakout board.

CAUTION! The P2 Edge Module power input pads have reverse polarity protection,
but damage could occur from user circuits attached to the IO pins incorrectly, so
care should always be taken to ensure correct orientation.

2. Power Jack
The 2.1 mm center-positive DC power barrel jack socket accepts 5 VDC only. To provide power we
recommend the Parallax USB A to DC Jack Cable (#805-00019) This will allow you to power the P2 Edge
Breakout Board from a computer USB port or hub. For higher current applications, connect the same
cable to the Parallax USB Mains Adapter (#750-00001).

CAUTION! Always use a well-regulated power supply and do not exceed 5.5 VDC
input!

3. Prop Plug Programming Header
The P2 Edge Module is programmed by the Parallax Prop Plug programming tool (#32201). To
accommodate the Prop Plug, there is a dedicated 4-pin programming and debugging header. The pins are
marked ▽ △ RES VSS, and correspond to the pin labeling on the Prop Plug adapter.
Connect the Prop Plug to your computer with a suitable USB cable. Then, insert the Prop Plug onto the
header pins with the Prop Plug components facing upward. The upward orientation allows you to see the
RX and TX activity LEDs on the Prop Plug while programming or debugging data is being transmitted.
4. Reset Button
Use this button to restart the Propeller 2 microcontroller’s program running on the P2 Edge Module. Press
and hold to keep the microcontroller in reset. Press and release to reset, load and run the program in
EEPROM.

5. Power Header
The 0.1” pitch 2x3 way power header comes with
two pre-installed 2-pin shunts to enable power to
the breakout board.
To disable power to the entire board, remove the
top “PWR ON” jumper.
To disable power only for the accessory header 5V
pins, remove the bottom “HDR 5V ON” jumper.
Each jumper could be replaced with a switch or
could be used to supply power directly to the
breakout board (instead of using the DC Barrel
Jack). This is an unsupported customer option please refer to the silk labeling on the bottom of the
breakout board and the schematic for further information.
PRO TIP: REMOVE THE HDR 5V ON JUMPER IF YOU ARE NOT USING THE 5V SUPPLY AT THE
2X6 WAY ACCESSORY HEADERS. Doing so will reduce the risk of accidentally causing damage during
experimentation; for example, should one of the 5V pins be accidentally connected to a signal or ground
pin. All I/O signal pins are rated for 3.3V only!

6. I/O Pin Accessory Headers (with 5V output)
With the P2 Edge Module plugged in, each of the Propeller 2's 64
smart I/O pins connect to an accessory header, in specific groups of
eight.
Each edge header provides two GND connections, a Vxx output pin
supplying the voltage from the corresponding 3.3 V LDO voltage
regulator (described here), and optionally a 5 V output that is
connected via the Power Header directly to the Power Jack.

DO NOT APPLY VOLTAGE TO THE Vxx Pin; it is a voltage output! Be aware that
some I/O pins are also connected to other peripheral circuits; see the Edge
Connector Pin Assignments section.

5V OUTPUT VOLTAGE IS PROVIDED TO POWER EXTERNAL ACCESSORIES &
SENSORS. DO NOT CONNECT 5V DIRECTLY TO ANY OF THE P2 SMART I/O PINS!
ALL I/O PINS OPERATE AT 3.3V LOGIC LEVEL AND ARE NOT 5V TOLERANT !

7. I/O Pin Breakout Edge Headers (without 5V output)
There are two edge headers that do not have 5V routed to them,
one for P24-–P31, and one for P56–P63.
The P24–P31 header is marked with a white silk square for the pin
beside the Vxx pin. This unlabelled pin is unconnected, but may be
used for connecting a user signal or voltage to a user accessory
board or prototype board.
The P56–P63 header is marked with the RES pin label beside the V56 pin.
The RES pin is active low, and is connected to the Propeller 2
microcontroller RESn circuit on the P2 Edge Module. Momentarily set
this pin low to reset the Propeller 2.
The P56–P63 header accepts the the Parallax P2 WX Adapter
(#64007) with the Parallax ESP8266 SIP WiFi module (#32420S) in
order to program the Propeller 2 wirelessly.

8. Mounting Holes
The four plated mounting holes are attached to the ground plane. See the PCB Dimensions section for
mounting hole dimensions, positions and spacing.

VIO 3.3V Power and Ground (GND) access
The positive 3.3 V supply sockets and ground sockets are positioned
around the board at the 2x6 way P2 accessory headers. The headers
are compatible with the Parallax P2 accessory boards, or use jumper
wires to connect the header pins to an external circuit- for example,
to a breadboard.
Each group of 8 smart I/O pins has its own 3.3 V low-noise regulator,
with short-circuit and over-current protection. You may see this

voltage referred to as VIO (Voltage for IO), and is labeled beside each group of I/O pins in the format
Vxx.
The two digits after the V refer to the first of 8 I/O pins that the LDO provides power to. For example in
the image, V48 would mean VIO voltage for I/O pins 48 to 55.
Warning: DO NOT join the Vxx pins together. The voltage output is intended to
provide logic level and low current supply only to the corresponding group of 8
I/Os (Maximum 30mA per pin, 300 mA total). If a larger current or common
supply is required, use an alternative power source such as the Parallax Power
Pal (#32133).
