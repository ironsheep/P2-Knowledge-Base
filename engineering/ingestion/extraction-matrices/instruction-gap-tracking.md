## Gap Categories

### Critical Instruction Matrices (From AD-001)
The remaining 165 instructions fall into systematic relationship patterns that need analysis:

1. **State Setup Matrix** - Instructions requiring setup→execute patterns
2. **Event System Matrix** - Event-related instruction dependencies  
3. **Smart Pin Matrix** - Pin configuration→operation chains
4. **COG Lifecycle Matrix** - Multi-COG interaction patterns
5. **FIFO/Queue Matrix** - Data transfer setup→operation chains
6. **Instruction Sequence Matrix** - Instructions modifying subsequent execution
7. **SETQ/SETQ2 Compatibility Matrix** - Block operation compatibility
8. **Conditional Execution Matrix** - IF_ family compatibility verification
9. **Flag Setting Reality Matrix** - WC/WZ syntax vs actual behavior
10. **ALT Family Matrix** - Dynamic instruction modification patterns

### High-Priority Categories
Based on frequency of usage and programming impact:

**Tier 1 (Critical - 45 instructions)**:
- Smart Pin configuration and control
- Hub memory access patterns  
- Event system setup and polling
- CORDIC solver operations
- Basic arithmetic with flag control

**Tier 2 (High - 65 instructions)**:
- Advanced pin I/O operations
- Specialized hardware control
