### Critical Insights Documented
- **ADDSX/SUBSX**: MUST be final instruction in multi-word signed operations
- **X suffix pattern**: Includes carry/borrow, ANDs Z flag for cumulative detection
- **S suffix pattern**: Returns true sign instead of carry/borrow
- **All math/logic**: Confirmed 2-cycle execution

### High Priority (Core Operations)
1. **CMP family** (CMP/CMPX/CMPS/CMPSX) - Complete the arithmetic set
2. **MOV** - Most basic operation
3. **JMP/CALL/RET** - Essential flow control
4. **RDLONG/WRLONG** - Hub memory access
5. **MUL/DIV** - Basic multiplication/division

### Medium Priority (Common Operations)
1. **Shift/Rotate** (SHL/SHR/ROL/ROR)
2. **Logic** (AND/OR/XOR/NOT)
3. **TEST** operations
4. **REP** - Loop instruction
5. **AUGS/AUGD** - Immediate extension

## üìù Methodology Notes

### What Makes an Instruction "Fully Documented"
1. **Encoding**: Complete 32-bit pattern from CSV
2. **Timing**: COG/LUT/HUB cycles from CSV columns H & I
3. **Semantics**: Operation description from Chip clarifications
4. **Flags**: C and Z flag behaviors documented
5. **Examples**: At least one usage example
6. **Related**: Links to family members
7. **Authority**: Sources cited and validated
8. **Conflicts**: Any conflicts resolved and documented

### Source Validation Process
1. Extract from primary sources
2. Cross-reference between sources
3. Flag any conflicts
4. Resolve using authority hierarchy
5. Document in master repository
