## üîÑ Update Process

When ingesting a new source:

1. **Update Questions**:
   - Add new questions to `questions-master.md`
   - Check if source answers questions in `questions-remaining.md`
   - Document any conflicts in `conflicts-and-trust-zones.md`

2. **Update Gaps**:
   - Mark filled gaps in `gaps-consolidated.md`
   - Add newly discovered gaps

3. **Update Instructions**:
   - Mark newly documented instructions in `instruction-completion-tracking.md`
   - Remove from `missing-instructions.md` if covered

4. **Update Matrices**:
   - Add source to `source-quality-matrix.md`
   - Assign trust level based on validation
