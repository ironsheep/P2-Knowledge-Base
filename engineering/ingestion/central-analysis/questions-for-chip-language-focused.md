# Essential Questions for Chip - Language Understanding Focus
*What we actually need for AI code generation*
*Date: 2025-08-15*

## üéØ THE REFRAME: We Need Language Semantics, Not Hardware Details

For AI to generate correct P2 code, we need to understand what instructions DO, not how chips boot or pins tolerate voltage.

## üî¥ PRIORITY 1: Instruction Semantics (The Real Gaps)

### Missing Instruction Descriptions (~300 instructions)
**Question for Chip**: "Can you provide one-sentence descriptions for these instruction groups?"

1. **Bit Manipulation Instructions**
   - TESTB, TESTBN, TESTB, BITL, BITH, BITC, BITNC, BITZ, BITNZ, BITRND, BITNOT
   - *What we need*: What each does to bits/flags

2. **ALU Operations** 
   - MODCZ, MODC, MODZ, SUMNC, SUMZ, SUMNZ
   - *What we need*: How they modify C/Z flags

3. **Branch/Skip Instructions**
   - MODCZ, MODZ, MODC effects on skipping
   - *What we need*: Exact skip conditions

4. **Special Operations**
   - SETQ, SETQ2, XORO32, XORO16
   - *What we need*: Purpose and usage patterns

**Why this matters**: Without knowing what instructions DO, AI can't choose the right one.

## üü° PRIORITY 2: Language Constructs

### Spin2 Operator Precedence
**Question**: "What's the complete precedence table for all Spin2 operators?"
- Need all 16 levels
- Especially floating-point and special operators

### Inline PASM2 Restrictions  
**Question**: "What are the exact rules for inline PASM2 in Spin2?"
- Register usage
- Label scope
- Instruction limitations

### Method Call Overhead
**Question**: "How many cycles for PUB/PRI calls with different parameter counts?"
- Helps AI choose between Spin2 and PASM2

## üü¢ PRIORITY 3: Common Patterns (Nice to Have)

### Multi-COG Coordination
**Question**: "What's your preferred pattern for COG communication?"
- Mailbox structure
- Lock usage
- Event signaling

### Performance Patterns
**Question**: "Any must-know optimization patterns?"
- Hub alignment tricks
- Pipeline-friendly sequences
- CORDIC usage patterns

## ‚ùå NOT NEEDED FOR CODE GENERATION

### Don't Ask About:
- Boot process (deployment concern)
- Electrical specs (hardware concern)  
- Silicon errata (tool concern)
- USB protocols (application-specific)
- Thermal characteristics (hardware)
- Package dimensions (hardware)

## üìù THE SIMPLIFIED ASK FOR CHIP

"Hi Chip,

We're building an AI knowledge base for P2 code generation. We have the instruction syntax but need semantics. 

Could you provide:
1. One-sentence descriptions for the ~300 undocumented instructions?
2. Complete Spin2 operator precedence table?
3. Inline PASM2 rules and restrictions?

We DON'T need boot/hardware/electrical details - just language understanding.

This would enable AI to generate syntactically AND semantically correct P2 code.

Thanks!"

## üí° WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS

1. **Focused Ask**: Language only, not hardware
2. **Manageable Scope**: ~300 sentences, not entire manuals
3. **Clear Value**: Enables AI code generation immediately
4. **Respects Time**: Specific, bounded request
5. **Separates Concerns**: Code generation ‚â† deployment

## üéØ BOTTOM LINE

**For AI Code Generation We Need:**
- What instructions DO (semantics)
- How language constructs work (precedence, rules)
- Common patterns (optional but helpful)

**We DON'T Need:**
- How hardware boots
- What voltages pins tolerate
- How USB protocols work
- Silicon manufacturing details

**This makes our ask 10x smaller and 10x more achievable!**
