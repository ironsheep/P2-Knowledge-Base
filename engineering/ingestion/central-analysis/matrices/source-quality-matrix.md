## 📊 **Complete Source Quality Assessment**

### **🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY - High Trust + Complete Extraction + Low Question Coverage**
*Perfect candidates for targeted Q&A research - reliable foundation, just needs depth*

| Source | Trust | Extraction | Q-Coverage | Priority Action |
|--------|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **P2 Edge 32MB Manual** | 🟢 GREEN | ✅ 100% | ❌ 30% | **🔴 Research PSRAM performance use cases** |
| **P2 Edge Standard Manual** | 🟢 GREEN | ✅ 100% | ❌ 35% | **🔴 Research pin usage statistics** |
| **Smart Pins Documentation** | 🟢 GREEN | ✅ 100% | ❌ 40% | **🔴 Research real-world pin mode applications** |
| **Spin2 Flash Loader Analysis** | 🟢 GREEN | ✅ 100% | ❌ 25% | **🔴 Research boot sequence optimization** |

### **🟡 HIGH PRIORITY - High Trust + Partial Extraction**
*Need to complete extraction first, then assess question coverage*

| Source | Trust | Extraction | Q-Coverage | Priority Action |
|--------|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **PASM2 Language Manual** | 🟢 GREEN | ⚠️ 64% | ❓ TBD | **🟡 Complete extraction of 176 missing instructions** |
| **P2 Silicon Documentation** | 🟢 GREEN | ❌ ~45%* | ❓ TBD | **🟡 Post-processing audit (flawed initial ingestion)** |

### **🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Various Trust/Coverage Combinations**
*Strategic decisions needed based on cost/benefit*

| Source | Trust | Extraction | Q-Coverage | Priority Action |
|--------|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Spin2 Documentation v51** | 🟢 GREEN | ✅ 100% | 🟡 60% | **🟢 Maintain - good coverage** |
| **P2 Hardware Manual** | 🟢 GREEN | ✅ 100% | 🟡 55% | **🟢 Monitor for specific gaps** |
| **Flash FS Analysis** | 🟢 GREEN | ✅ 100% | 🟡 70% | **🟢 Maintain - adequate coverage** |
| **Q&A Spreadsheet** | ⚠️ YELLOW | ✅ 100% | 🟡 50% | **🟡 Cross-validate against official sources** |

### **🔴 REPLACE PRIORITY - Low Trust Sources**
*Don't invest research time in unreliable sources*

| Source | Trust | Extraction | Q-Coverage | Priority Action |
|--------|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| *None Currently* | - | - | - | **✅ Good - no low-trust sources identified** |

## 🎯 **Strategic Work Allocation Guide**

### **Immediate Focus (This Sprint)**
1. **P2 Edge 32MB Performance Research** (2 hours)
   - Questions: PSRAM performance comparisons, use case justification, pin trade-off analysis
   - Expected Outcome: Complete sales case for 32MB module selection

2. **Complete PASM2 Manual Extraction** (3 hours)
   - Gap: 176 missing instructions (64% → 100% completion)
   - Expected Outcome: Full instruction reference

### **Next Sprint Candidates**
1. **Silicon Doc Post-Processing Audit** (4 hours)
   - Fix flawed initial ingestion, bring to 100% extraction
   - High impact due to foundational importance

2. **Smart Pins Real-World Applications Research** (2 hours)
   - Question coverage from 40% → 80%
   - High-value because Smart Pins are P2's key differentiator

### **Maintenance Queue**
- Monitor Spin2 v51 for gaps (already 60% question coverage)
- Cross-validate Q&A Spreadsheet findings against official sources

## 📈 **Question Coverage Assessment Method**

### **Critical Question Categories (5 types):**
1. **Decision-Making**: "When should I use this?"
2. **Performance**: "What can this do that alternatives can't?"
3. **Implementation**: "How do I actually use this?"
4. **Trade-offs**: "What do I give up by choosing this?"
5. **Integration**: "How does this work with other components?"

### **Coverage Scoring:**
- **90-100%**: Excellent (most critical questions answered)
- **70-89%**: Good (adequate for most users)
- **50-69%**: Moderate (basic questions answered)
- **30-49%**: Poor (significant gaps)
- **0-29%**: Critical (major information gaps)

### **Example - P2 Edge 32MB Question Coverage Analysis:**
**Total Critical Questions Identified**: 23
**Questions Adequately Answered**: 7
**Coverage Score**: 30% (7/23)

**Missing Question Types:**
- Decision-Making: 6/7 missing (86% gap)
- Performance: 4/6 missing (67% gap)  
- Trade-offs: 5/5 missing (100% gap)
- Implementation: 2/3 answered (good coverage)
- Integration: 1/2 answered (moderate coverage)

## 🚨 **Priority Alert System**

### **🔴 RED ALERT: Critical Action Needed**
- **P2 Edge 32MB**: Trusted source with complete extraction but only 30% question coverage
- **Impact**: Users can't make informed module selection decisions
- **Effort**: 2 hours of targeted research
- **ROI**: Prevents developer project failures due to wrong module choice

### **🟡 YELLOW ALERT: High Value Target**
- **PASM2 Manual**: Missing 36% of instructions (176/491)
- **Impact**: Incomplete instruction reference limits AI code generation
- **Effort**: 3 hours systematic extraction
- **ROI**: Completes foundational P2 programming reference

### **🟢 GREEN STATUS: Well Covered**
- **Flash FS Analysis**: 70% question coverage, maintains current status
- **Spin2 v51**: 60% coverage, adequate for current needs

## 💡 **Operational Recommendations**

### **Resource Allocation Strategy:**
1. **80% effort → High Trust + Low Question Coverage** (proven sources needing depth)
2. **15% effort → Complete partial extractions** (fill extraction gaps)
3. **5% effort → Source monitoring/maintenance** (prevent degradation)

### **Decision Framework:**
**Before starting any research:**
1. Check Trust Level - if RED, find better source first
2. Check Extraction % - if <80%, complete extraction first  
3. Check Question Coverage - if <50%, research targeted questions
4. Prioritize: HIGH trust + LOW coverage = maximum ROI

### **Success Metrics:**
- **Week 1**: Increase 32MB module question coverage 30% → 80%
- **Week 2**: Increase PASM2 extraction completeness 64% → 100%
- **Week 3**: Audit Silicon Doc extraction quality
- **Month**: 90% of HIGH trust sources above 70% question coverage
