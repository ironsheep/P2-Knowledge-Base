## Major Discoveries (2025-09-02 Update)

### Chip Gracey Extended Precision Patterns
- **AUTHORITATIVE patterns** for 64-bit and 128-bit arithmetic
- **Critical discovery**: ADDSX/SUBSX usage for signed multi-word operations
- **Complete patterns** for unsigned and signed extended precision

## Previous Major Discoveries

### Smart Pins Revolution
- **From 60% → 95% coverage** by combining Silicon Doc + Titus sources
- **Zero conflicts** between sources - perfect alignment
- Revealed as P2's defining feature: 64 independent hardware units
- Each Smart Pin eliminates 15-100% COG overhead for I/O operations

### Critical Silicon Bugs Documented
1. **SETQ/PTRx Bug**: ALTx/AUGS/AUGD between SETQ and block transfers breaks PTRx updates
2. **AUGS/ALTx Bug**: Unintended AUGS consumption by intervening ALTx instructions
- Both bugs now 100% documented with workarounds

### COG RAM Architecture Revealed
- Complete register map $000-$1FF documented
- PTRA/PTRB at $1F8/$1F9 confirmed
- Debug ISR ROM overlay at $1F8-$1FF understood
- WW field encoding for PA/PB/PTRA/PTRB decoded

### Instruction Pipeline Understanding
- 5-stage pipeline diagram captured
- 2-clock baseline timing confirmed
- GETPTR revealed as FIFO pointer, not PTRA/PTRB reader

### Complete CSV Extraction Success
- All 491 instructions with encodings
- Complete timing data (COG/LUT and Hub)
- All C/Z flag behaviors documented
- Interrupt shielding information
- Register/Hub/Stack access patterns

### P2docs.github.io Findings (REQUIRE VERIFICATION)

- HDMI/DVI hardware support claims
- Bytecode engine performance metrics
- ⚠️ WARNING: May include Flexspin compiler features, not hardware

## Summary Statistics

- **High Coverage (🟩 76-100%)**: 20 items (36%) ⬆️ from 19
- **Good Coverage (🟦 51-75%)**: 12 items (22%) ⬇️ from 17
- **Partial Coverage (🟨 26-50%)**: 9 items (16%) ⬇️ from 14
- **Minimal Coverage (🟥 1-25%)**: 16 items (29%) ⬇️ from 20
- **Not Documented (⬛ 0%)**: 2 items (4%) unchanged

**Overall Coverage**: ~76% verified (continued improvement with Chip's clarifications)

## Priority Gaps (High-Impact Missing Knowledge)

1. **Complete Instruction Set** - Need to fully process CSV for all instructions
2. **USB Implementation** - Smart Pin mode exists but no details
3. **Hub Long Boundaries** - Critical for timing calculations
4. **FIFO Operations** - RDFAST/WRFAST not fully understood
5. **Streamer Programming** - Major feature poorly documented
6. **Lock Mechanism** - 16 locks available but usage unknown
7. **Event System** - 16 events listed but not explained

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Mine CSV completely** - All instruction encodings and timing
2. **Find USB implementation** - Last major Smart Pin gap
3. **Extract Streamer details** - Major data movement feature
4. **Document Event system** - Foundation for interrupts/polling
5. **Map FIFO operations** - Key to fast hub access
