## Overall Instruction Coverage

### Statistics
- **Total P2 Instructions**: ~350-400 (exact count varies by variants)
- **Well Documented (>75%)**: ~220 instructions (63%)
- **Partially Documented (25-75%)**: ~100 instructions (28%)
- **Poorly Documented (<25%)**: ~30 instructions (9%)

### Overall Coverage: **68%**

## Critical Gaps

### High Priority (Blocking for applications)
1. **Streamer modes** - Essential for video/DMA
2. **Lock mechanisms** - Multi-cog coordination
3. **USB implementation** - Smart Pin mode %11011
4. **FIFO details** - RDFAST/WRFAST operations

### Medium Priority (Important but workable)
1. **Complete timing verification** - All instructions
2. **Condition code usage** - All branch instructions
3. **Event programming** - Complete examples
4. **SKIP patterns** - Complex sequences

### Low Priority (Nice to have)
1. **Edge cases** - Rare instruction combinations
2. **Optimization patterns** - Performance tricks
3. **Undocumented features** - Hidden capabilities

## Source Value Assessment

### Most Valuable Sources
1. **Silicon Doc** - Authoritative, comprehensive
2. **P2docs.github.io** - Fills critical gaps (pixel ops, XBYTE)
3. **CSV** - Complete encodings and timing
4. **Titus examples** - Practical Smart Pin usage

### Integration Success
- **Zero conflicts** between sources
- **Complementary coverage** - Each source adds unique value
- **Cross-validation** successful where overlap exists

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Mine Silicon Doc Streamer section** - Last major gap
2. **Process complete CSV** - Extract all timing data
3. **Verify P2docs timing claims** - Critical for performance
4. **Document Lock instructions** - Multi-cog essential

### Documentation Priorities
1. Create comprehensive instruction reference
2. Add timing specifications for all instructions
3. Include practical examples from Titus
4. Verify and integrate P2docs details

### For Knowledge Base
- Current instruction coverage: **68%**
- Target after full extraction: **85-90%**
- Achievable with existing sources
- No additional sources required for core functionality

## Conclusion

We have sufficient sources to achieve excellent instruction coverage. The combination of:
- Silicon Doc (authority)
- CSV (encodings/timing)
- P2docs (behavioral details)
- Titus (practical examples)

Provides a comprehensive instruction knowledge base. The main work remaining is systematic extraction and verification rather than finding new sources.
