# Document Ingestion Work Mode Guide

**Single Purpose**: Complete document ingestion plan, task generation, execution, and wrap-up process

**This document provides**: 
1. **Ingestion Plan & Process** ‚Üí generates ‚Üí **MCP Tasks** ‚Üí enables ‚Üí **Systematic Execution** ‚Üí results in ‚Üí **Knowledge Base Integration**

## üö® SESSION START INTEGRATION

### Work Mode Identification
**Trigger Phrases**: "new document ingestion", "ingestion audit", "source ingestion", "add new document"
**Confirmation**: "This covers complete document ingestion from source to verified knowledge base entry"

### Two Ways Ingestion Can Be Initiated

#### **Path 1: Pick Next from Pipeline**
**User says**: "Do the next ingestion" / "Pick up the next document" / "Continue with ingestion queue"
**Process**: 
- Go directly to Step 1 below (check priority sources queue)
- Follow established priority order
- Work on highest priority unprocessed document

#### **Path 2: Human Specifies Document**
**User says**: "Ingest [document name]" / "Process the [document name] document"
**Process**:
- Search `/sources/originals/` for files containing the specified name
- If found: Use that file as the source document
- Read the actual document title/metadata from the file
- Use the document's real title to derive folder names (e.g., `edge-32mb-complete-extraction-audit`)
- **Document name for folders = derived from actual document title, NOT user's reference name**

### Todo MCP Integration  
**CRITICAL - Always use this filter:**
```bash
mcp__todo-mcp__todo_next tags:["document_ingestion"]
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ‚úÖ **Focuses on ingestion-specific tasks** 
- ‚úÖ **Prevents mixing ingestion with generation** 
- ‚úÖ **Ensures systematic progression** from raw source to verified knowledge

### üéØ **CRITICAL TAGGING RULE**
**ALL tasks generated by this workflow MUST use the tag: `["document_ingestion"]`**

**This ensures**:
- `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_next tags:["document_ingestion"]` returns ONLY your ingestion tasks
- No interference from other work mode tasks
- Clean, focused execution environment
- Proper task sequencing within ingestion workflow

---

## üîÑ DOCUMENT INGESTION WORKFLOW
*Follow this exact sequence for optimal results*

### üö® MANDATORY FIRST STEP: TASK GENERATION
**BEFORE ANY WORK BEGINS - ALWAYS CREATE THE 5 CORE TASKS**

```bash
# REQUIRED: Create these 5 tasks IMMEDIATELY when starting any ingestion
mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Phase 1: Setup and document assessment for [document-name]" priority:"critical" estimate_minutes:15 tags:["document_ingestion"] sequence:1

mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Phase 2: Complete content ingestion of [document-name]" priority:"critical" estimate_minutes:60 tags:["document_ingestion"] sequence:2

mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Phase 3: Execute 5-pass validation framework for [document-name]" priority:"critical" estimate_minutes:45 tags:["document_ingestion"] sequence:3

mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Phase 4: Create complete extraction audit document for [document-name]" priority:"critical" estimate_minutes:30 tags:["document_ingestion"] sequence:4

mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Phase 5: Update all system catalogs and dashboards for [document-name]" priority:"critical" estimate_minutes:20 tags:["document_ingestion"] sequence:5

# Set tracking context
mcp__todo-mcp__context_set key:"ingestion_active_[document-name]" value:"Started: [timestamp], Document: [full-path], Tasks generated: 5 core tasks"
```

**WHY THIS IS MANDATORY:**
- ‚úÖ Prevents skipping critical steps (like dashboard updates)
- ‚úÖ Provides clear progress tracking through MCP tasks
- ‚úÖ Enables recovery if session is interrupted
- ‚úÖ Ensures systematic completion verification
- ‚úÖ Maintains audit trail of all ingestion work

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER SKIP TASK CREATION** - Even for "simple" documents, create all 5 tasks first

### PHASE 1: SETUP & PREPARATION
**ALWAYS START TASK FIRST**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_start position_id:1`

#### Step 1: Identify Source Document
```bash
# Check current ingestion queue
mcp__filesystem__read_text_file path:"/documentation/ingestion-pipeline/priority-sources-queue.md"
```

#### Step 2: Locate and Assess Source File
**ALWAYS READ FROM**: `/sources/originals/[filename]`
- Verify source file exists and is complete
- **Check file size** using `ls -lh` or file info tools
- Note file date, version information
- Never modify originals

#### Step 2.5: Size Assessment and Preprocessing (CRITICAL)
**PDF Size Limits**: Claude's PDF reader has size constraints

**IF file size > 10MB OR document appears truncated when reading:**
1. **Convert PDF to text first**:
   ```bash
   pdftotext /path/to/large-document.pdf /path/to/large-document.txt
   ```
2. **Use converted text file for ingestion**
3. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Schedule image extraction** - PDF-to-text conversion loses all visual content
4. **Note in audit**: "Processed via PDF-to-text conversion due to size"
5. **Update catalog**: Mark document as "PENDING" for image extraction, not "N/A"

**IF file size ‚â§ 10MB:**
- Proceed directly with PDF reading
- Monitor for truncation during reading
- If truncated: Fall back to PDF-to-text conversion

**Size Check Command**:
```bash
ls -lh /sources/originals/[filename]
# If shows >10M, use pdftotext conversion
```

#### Step 3: Required Context Reading
**Read these for background (do this ONCE per session):**
1. `/documentation/ingestion-pipeline/ingestion-audit-protocol.md` - Methodology
2. `/documentation/pipelines/p2kb-document-production-process.md` - Quality standards

---

**COMPLETE TASK**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_complete position_id:1` when Phase 1 is done

### PHASE 2: CONTENT INGESTION
**ALWAYS START TASK FIRST**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_start position_id:1`
*Pure information absorption - no documentation yet*

#### Step 4: Systematic Document Reading
**Goal**: Absorb all content into working knowledge
**Process**:
- Read through entire source document systematically (PDF or converted text)
- **If using converted text**: Be aware of potential formatting loss, tables may be harder to parse
- Focus on understanding concepts and relationships
- Note technical specifications and parameters
- **üè∑Ô∏è CRITICAL: Track Part Numbers** - Hardware documents often contain 5-digit part numbers with # prefixes (#64000, #32420S, etc.)
- Identify cross-references to other sources
- **Monitor for truncation**: If content seems incomplete, use PDF-to-text conversion
- **DO NOT document anything yet** - just absorb

#### Step 5: Interactive Verification Assessment
**Goal**: Determine if immediate verification is possible or needs scheduling
**Process**:
1. **Attempt self-verification**: Test your own understanding of key concepts
2. **Assess extraction quality**: Are there areas that seem incomplete or unclear?
3. **Check document accessibility**: Were any sections difficult to parse or understand?

**IF extraction seems complete and clear**:
- Proceed to Step 6 (Targeted Re-ingestion if needed)
- Continue with workflow

**IF extraction has issues OR document is complex**:
- **Schedule Interactive Verification**: Create Todo MCP task for user-guided verification session
- Continue with current workflow using best available understanding
- Interactive verification will be handled separately

**Interactive Verification Scheduling**:
```bash
# When extraction quality is questionable:
mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Interactive verification for [document-name] - user-guided gap identification and testing" priority:"high" estimate_minutes:60 tags:["interactive_verification", "document_ingestion"]
```

#### Step 6: Targeted Re-ingestion (If Self-Assessment Identifies Gaps)
**Goal**: Fill gaps identified during self-assessment
**Process**:
- Focus ONLY on gap areas identified in Step 5
- Re-read missed sections thoroughly
- Capture overlooked specifications
- **Note**: If interactive verification was scheduled, this step uses best current understanding

**COMPLETE TASK**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_complete position_id:1` when Phase 2 is done

### PHASE 3: VALIDATION & ANALYSIS
**ALWAYS START TASK FIRST**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_start position_id:1`
*Systematic validation of absorbed knowledge*

#### Step 7: 5-Pass Validation Framework
**CRITICAL**: Complete all 5 passes before any documentation

**Pass 1: Questions Answered Audit**
- What gaps from previous sources does this fill?
- Identify specific questions now answerable
- Note confidence level for each answer
- **Also identify**: Code examples present, Images/diagrams present

**Pass 2: New Questions Discovered**
- What new unknowns does this document reveal?
- Categorize by type (Hardware/Software/Performance/etc.)
- Assess implications of each new question

**Pass 3: Conflict Detection**
- Check for contradictions with existing knowledge
- Most results: "No Direct Conflicts" with justification
- If conflicts exist: Document for resolution

**Pass 4: Unique Value Assessment**
- Compare against each existing major source
- Identify what this source provides that others don't
- Note new capabilities this enables

**Pass 5: Cross-Reference Verification**
- Validate information against other sources
- Check consistency of shared topics
- Verify technical specifications match

**COMPLETE TASK**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_complete position_id:1` when Phase 3 is done

### PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION
**ALWAYS START TASK FIRST**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_start position_id:1`
*Create permanent record of ingestion results*

#### Step 8: Create Audit Document
**LOCATION**: `/sources/extractions/[document-name]-complete-extraction-audit.md`

**STRUCTURE** (use this exact format):
```markdown

**COMPLETE TASK**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_complete position_id:1` when Phase 4 is done

### PHASE 5: SYSTEM UPDATES
**ALWAYS START TASK FIRST**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_start position_id:1`
*Update tracking systems with completed work*

#### Step 10: Update Source Catalog
**LOCATION**: `/sources/INGESTED-SOURCES-CATALOG.md`
**UPDATES REQUIRED**:
- Add document entry to appropriate table
- Update summary statistics (total sources, paragraphs, coverage)
- Update trust level distribution
- Increment knowledge coverage percentage

#### Step 10.5: Update Central Analysis Hub
**LOCATION**: `/engineering/ingestion/central-analysis/`
**CRITICAL UPDATES REQUIRED**:

**Cross-Source Q&A**:
- Add new questions to `cross-source-qa/questions-master.md`
- Move answered questions from `cross-source-qa/questions-remaining.md` to answered section
- Document conflicts in `cross-source-qa/conflicts-and-trust-zones.md`

**Knowledge Gaps**:
- Update `knowledge-gaps/gaps-consolidated.md` with filled/new gaps
- Reorganize `knowledge-gaps/gaps-by-category.md` as needed

**Instruction Analysis** (if applicable):
- Update `instruction-analysis/instruction-completion-tracking.md`
- Remove documented instructions from `instruction-analysis/missing-instructions.md`

**Matrices**:
- Add source to `matrices/source-quality-matrix.md` with trust assessment

#### Step 11: Update Operations Dashboard
**LOCATION**: `/engineering/README.md` (was OPERATIONS-DASHBOARD.md)
**UPDATES REQUIRED**:
- Update ecosystem status section (if hardware)
- Update mission metrics and coverage percentages
- Update knowledge improvement statistics
- Note new capabilities unlocked

#### Step 12: Schedule Additional Extractions (If Needed)
**üéØ NEW APPROACH: Use Planning Matrices, Not Tasks**

**IF DOCUMENT CONTAINS CODE EXAMPLES**:
- **Add to Code Extraction Matrix**: `/sources/visual-assets/CODE-EXAMPLE-EXTRACTION-MATRIX.md`
- **Priority classification**: High (code examples are immediately actionable)
- **Expected count estimate**: Based on document scan
- **Language breakdown**: Spin2/PASM2/Config patterns

**IF DOCUMENT CONTAINS IMAGES/DIAGRAMS**:
- **Add to Image Extraction Matrix**: `/sources/visual-assets/INGESTION-IMAGE-EXTRACTION-MATRIX.md`  
- **Priority classification**: Critical/High/Medium based on content type
- **Expected count estimate**: Based on document scan
- **Content type**: Board photos, diagrams, screenshots, etc.

**‚úÖ MATRIX BENEFITS vs TASK CREATION**:
- **Strategic planning**: Extraction work gets proper prioritization vs other extraction work
- **Clean task lists**: Active tasks stay focused on immediate execution work
- **Systematic tracking**: All extraction opportunities tracked in central location
- **Resource planning**: Can batch similar extraction work efficiently

**IF INTERACTIVE VERIFICATION WAS SCHEDULED** (from Step 5):
- Ensure the task was created with proper tags
- Priority: "high" (verification affects knowledge quality)
- Note: "Document ingested with potential gaps, interactive verification scheduled"

**Example Task Creation**:
```bash
# For code examples found:
mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Extract code examples from P2-Silicon-Doc using automated extraction tools" priority:"high" estimate_minutes:45 tags:["code_extraction", "document_ingestion"]

# For images/diagrams found:
mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Extract images from P2-Hardware-Manual using PDF image extraction tools" priority:"medium" estimate_minutes:30 tags:["image_extraction", "document_ingestion"]

# For interactive verification needed:
mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Interactive verification for P2-Silicon-Doc - user-guided gap identification and testing" priority:"high" estimate_minutes:60 tags:["interactive_verification", "document_ingestion"]
```

#### Step 13: Update Integration Touchpoints
**CHECK AND UPDATE IF NEEDED**:
- Hardware ecosystem matrices (if hardware document)
- Compatibility analyses (if new hardware/software combinations)
- Cross-reference indices (if new relationships discovered)
- Work mode guides (if new processes/tooling available)

#### Step 14: Generate Enhanced Ingestion Summary

**COMPLETE TASK**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_complete position_id:1` when Phase 5 is done

#### Step 15: MANDATORY COMPLETION VERIFICATION
**BEFORE DECLARING INGESTION COMPLETE:**

```bash
# Verify all core tasks completed
mcp__todo-mcp__todo_list tags:["document_ingestion"]
# Should show 5 completed tasks, 0 pending

# Verify all files exist
# Check audit document created
# Check catalogs updated
# Check dashboard updated
# Check context keys cleaned up
```

## üéØ TASK GENERATION & EXECUTION METHODOLOGY
*How to systematically manage the ingestion process through Todo MCP*

### Phase A: Initial Task Generation
**IMMEDIATELY after receiving document ingestion request:**

#### Step A1: Generate Core Ingestion Tasks
**CRITICAL**: All tasks MUST use tag `["document_ingestion"]` to match this work mode's filter

```bash
# Create primary ingestion tasks with proper sequencing
mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Phase 1: Setup and document assessment for [document-name]" priority:"critical" estimate_minutes:15 tags:["document_ingestion"] sequence:1

mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Phase 2: Complete content ingestion of [document-name]" priority:"critical" estimate_minutes:60 tags:["document_ingestion"] sequence:2

mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Phase 3: Execute 5-pass validation framework for [document-name]" priority:"critical" estimate_minutes:45 tags:["document_ingestion"] sequence:3

mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Phase 4: Create complete extraction audit document for [document-name]" priority:"critical" estimate_minutes:30 tags:["document_ingestion"] sequence:4

mcp__todo-mcp__todo_create content:"Phase 5: Update all system catalogs and dashboards for [document-name]" priority:"critical" estimate_minutes:20 tags:["document_ingestion"] sequence:5
```

#### Step A2: Set Context Tracking
```bash
# Track ingestion progress
mcp__todo-mcp__context_set key:"ingestion_active_[document-name]" value:"Started: [timestamp], Document: [full-path], Tasks generated: 5 core tasks"
```

### Phase B: Systematic Task Execution
**Execute tasks in sequence, marking progress:**

#### Task Execution Pattern
1. **Start next task**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_start position_id:1`
2. **Execute the work** (following 13-step process within each phase)
3. **Complete task**: `mcp__todo-mcp__todo_complete position_id:1` 
4. **Generate follow-up tasks if discovered** (extraction scheduling)
5. **Move to next task**

#### Step B1: Phase 1 Execution (Setup & Assessment)
**When working on Phase 1 task:**
- Execute Steps 1-3 from workflow
- If large PDF discovered: Note in context, handle preprocessing
- Update task with findings before completing

#### Step B2: Phase 2 Execution (Content Ingestion) 
**When working on Phase 2 task:**
- Execute Steps 4-6 from workflow
- If interactive verification needed: Generate additional task immediately
- Document any ingestion challenges in context

#### Step B3: Phase 3 Execution (5-Pass Validation)
**When working on Phase 3 task:**
- Execute Step 7 (all 5 passes) from workflow
- Store validation results in context temporarily
- If code/images discovered: Note for Phase 5 task generation

#### Step B4: Phase 4 Execution (Documentation)
**When working on Phase 4 task:**
- Execute Steps 8-9 from workflow
- Transfer validation results from context to audit document
- Ensure all required sections completed

#### Step B5: Phase 5 Execution (System Updates)
**When working on Phase 5 task:**
- Execute Steps 10-13 from workflow
- Generate extraction tasks if needed (code/images/verification)
- Update all required system documents
- Clear temporary context keys

### Phase C: Completion Verification
**Before marking ingestion complete:**

#### Step C1: Completeness Check
```bash
# Verify all tasks completed
mcp__todo-mcp__todo_list tags:["document_ingestion"]
# Should show all tasks as completed

# Verify success criteria met
# Check audit document exists
# Check catalogs updated
# Check any extraction tasks created
```

#### Step C2: Final Context Update
```bash
# Mark ingestion complete
mcp__todo-mcp__context_set key:"ingestion_complete_[document-name]" value:"Completed: [timestamp], Status: SUCCESS, Audit: [path-to-audit], Extractions scheduled: [count]"

# Clean up active ingestion tracking
mcp__todo-mcp__context_delete key:"ingestion_active_[document-name]"
```

### Task Management Best Practices

#### Always Use Sequence Numbers
- **Critical priority** for all core ingestion tasks
- **Sequence 1-5** for the 5 phases
- **Higher sequences** for extraction tasks (6, 7, 8...)

#### Context Keys for Tracking
- `ingestion_active_[doc]`: Current work state
- `ingestion_validation_[doc]`: Temporary validation results
- `ingestion_complete_[doc]`: Final completion record

#### Error Recovery
- If task fails: Pause, diagnose, create recovery task
- If validation incomplete: Schedule interactive verification
- If system updates fail: Create specific repair task

**This methodology ensures**: Nothing gets missed, progress is trackable, work is systematic, recovery is possible

---

## üö® CRITICAL RULES

### Source Validation Hierarchy
1. **Fully Trusted** (GREEN): P2 official docs, Chip Gracey posts, verified code
2. **Conditionally Trusted** (YELLOW): Community content, unverified examples
3. **Never Use** (RED): P1 specifications, contradicted information

### P1‚ÜíP2 Error Prevention
- **Clock speeds**: P2 = 160-300MHz (NOT P1's 50-80MHz)
- **Hub RAM**: P2 = 512KB (NOT P1's 32KB)
- **I/O pins**: P2 = 64 (NOT P1's 32)
- **Performance**: P2 ~100 MIPS @ 200MHz (NOT P1's 25 @ 50MHz)

### Quality Standards
- Mark uncertainties with `:::review`
- Mark missing content with `:::missing`
- Track source lineage (page/section numbers)
- Complete all validation passes before documentation
- Update systems only after work is verified complete
