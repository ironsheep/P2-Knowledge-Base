# Source Document Ingestion Methodology

*Comprehensive framework for extracting content AND style from source documentation*

---

## üéØ Purpose

When ingesting source documentation, we capture:
1. **Content**: The technical information itself
2. **Style**: The writing patterns, structure, and conventions
3. **Metadata**: Source lineage, version, authorship

This enables us to either replicate trusted styles or intentionally design alternatives.

## üìä Style Analysis Framework

### Level 1: Document Architecture
- **Overall Structure**: How is the document organized?
- **Section Hierarchy**: What heading levels and patterns?
- **Flow Pattern**: Linear tutorial? Reference? Mixed?
- **Navigation Aids**: TOC, indexes, cross-references?

### Level 2: Content Patterns
- **Information Density**: Terse reference vs verbose explanation
- **Example Strategy**: Inline? Separate sections? Frequency?
- **Visual Elements**: Tables, diagrams, code blocks
- **Progressive Disclosure**: How complexity is introduced

### Level 3: Voice & Tone
- **Perspective**: First person? Second person? Passive?
- **Formality Level**: Academic? Conversational? Technical?
- **Audience Assumptions**: What knowledge is presumed?
- **Instruction Style**: Imperative? Descriptive? Explanatory?

### Level 4: Micro-patterns
- **Sentence Structure**: Simple? Complex? Average length?
- **Terminology Usage**: Defined inline? Glossary? Assumed?
- **Emphasis Techniques**: Bold? Italics? CAPS? Quotes?
- **Warning/Note Style**: How are important points highlighted?

## üîÑ Ingestion Process Enhancement

### Phase 1: Initial Content Extraction
Traditional extraction of technical content, facts, specifications

### Phase 2: Style Capture (NEW)
```markdown
## Style Analysis: [Source Document Name]

### Document Architecture
- Structure: [describe overall organization]
- Hierarchy: [heading patterns observed]
- Flow: [tutorial/reference/mixed]
- Navigation: [TOC/index/cross-ref style]

### Content Patterns
- Density: [terse/moderate/verbose]
- Examples: [frequency, placement, complexity]
- Visuals: [tables/diagrams/code ratio]
- Progression: [how complexity builds]

### Voice & Tone
- Perspective: [1st/2nd/3rd person]

- Audience: [assumed knowledge level]
- Instructions: [style used]

### Micro-patterns
- Sentences: [avg length, complexity]
- Terms: [definition strategy]
- Emphasis: [techniques used]
- Alerts: [warning/note format]

### Distinctive Features
[What makes this document's style unique?]

### Replication Guide
[If we wanted to write in this style, what rules would we follow?]
```

### Phase 3: Pattern Library Creation
Build reusable style templates from analyzed documents

---

## üìö Style Template Library

### Template Structure
```markdown
# Style Template: [Name]
*Based on: [Source Document]*

## Quick Identity
- **Best For**: [use cases]
- **Avoid For**: [anti-patterns]
- **Signature Elements**: [what makes it recognizable]

## Writing Rules
1. [Specific rule with example]
2. [Specific rule with example]
...

## Structure Template
[Markdown template showing section organization]

## Example Transformation
**Generic Content**: [plain fact]
**In This Style**: [styled version]
```

## üé® Style Selection Matrix

When creating new documentation, choose style based on:

| Purpose | Recommended Style | Source Template |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| API Reference | Terse, systematic | Silicon Doc |
| Tutorial | Progressive, example-rich | DeSilva Guide |
| Quick Reference | Dense, tabular | Instruction Spreadsheet |
| Comprehensive Manual | Structured, complete | PASM2 Manual |
| AI Training | Structured, unambiguous | AI-Optimized Format |

## üìã Ingestion Checklist

### For Every Source Document:
- [ ] Extract technical content
- [ ] Complete style analysis framework
- [ ] Identify distinctive features
- [ ] Create replication guide
- [ ] Add to style template library
- [ ] Update style selection matrix
- [ ] Document source lineage
- [ ] **Cross-Source Q&A Audit** (NEW)

### Quality Questions:
- Could someone replicate this style from our analysis?
- Have we captured what makes this document effective?
- Do we understand the author's choices?
- Can we articulate when to use/avoid this style?
- **Does this source answer questions from previous sources?**
- **What new questions does this source raise?**

---

## üîÑ Cross-Source Q&A Audit (NEW)

### Purpose
Track how each new source document answers questions raised by previous sources, building trust in our data through cross-validation.

### Process

#### Step 1: Review Previous Questions
For each new source, review all unanswered questions from:
- Master gaps document
- Previous source audit reports
- Extraction documents
- Sprint planning questions

#### Step 2: Mark Answered Questions
Document which questions this source answers:
```markdown
## Questions Answered by [Source Name]

### From [Previous Source]:
‚úÖ **Question**: [Original question]
   **Answer**: [Answer from new source with page/section reference]
   **Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]

‚ö†Ô∏è **Question**: [Original question]
   **Partial Answer**: [What was answered and what remains]
   **Still Need**: [What information is still missing]
```

#### Step 3: Identify New Questions
Document new questions raised by this source:
```markdown
## New Questions Raised

### Technical Questions:
1. [Question] - [Why this matters]
2. [Question] - [Impact on understanding]

### Implementation Questions:
1. [Question] - [Practical importance]
```

#### Step 4: Track Conflicts
Document any contradictions:
```markdown
## Conflicts Identified

‚ö†Ô∏è **Conflict**: [Topic]
- **Source A says**: [Statement with reference]
- **Source B says**: [Conflicting statement with reference]
- **Resolution**: [Which is authoritative and why]
```

#### Step 5: Update Master Tracking
Maintain a master question status:
```markdown
## Question Status Summary

### Fully Answered (Trust Level: HIGH)
- [Question] - Answered by [Sources]
- [Question] - Confirmed by [Multiple sources]

### Partially Answered (Trust Level: MEDIUM)
- [Question] - Partial in [Source], need [Detail]

### Still Open (Trust Level: LOW)
- [Question] - No source addresses this
```

### Trust Building Metrics

**Data Trust Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ **High Trust**: Multiple sources confirm, no conflicts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium Trust**: Single source, no conflicts
- ‚ùå **Low Trust**: Conflicts exist or gaps remain

**Source Completeness Score**:
- Questions answered from previous sources: X/Y
- New questions raised: Z
- Conflicts introduced: N
- Trust improvement: +X% (answered questions / total questions)

### Benefits

1. **Builds Confidence**: Know which data to trust
2. **Identifies Gaps**: Clear view of what's still needed
3. **Resolves Conflicts**: Systematic conflict resolution
4. **Tracks Progress**: Measurable trust improvement

## üöÄ Implementation in Sprints

### During Ingestion Sprints:
1. Allocate time for style analysis (typically +30% to extraction time)
2. Create style analysis document alongside content extraction
3. Build style template if document represents new pattern
4. Update style selection matrix with findings

### During Generation Sprints:
1. Select target style from template library
2. Apply style rules consistently
3. Validate output against style template
4. Document any style adaptations made

---

## üìà Benefits of Style Capture

1. **Consistency**: New documents can match trusted styles
2. **Intentionality**: Style choices become deliberate, not accidental
3. **Efficiency**: Templates accelerate document creation
4. **Quality**: Understanding effective styles improves our output
5. **Flexibility**: Can mix styles appropriately for different sections
