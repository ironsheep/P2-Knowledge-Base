# Vision Documents Catalog

*Comprehensive catalog of all vision, strategy, and goal documents in the repository*  
*Created: 2025-08-31*

## Purpose

This catalog identifies all documents that describe project vision, system design, strategies, or intended outcomes. These documents inform how the repository structure should support project goals and may need integration into section overviews or guidance documents.

## Strategic Vision Documents

### 1. P2-Claude Enablement Strategy
**Location**: `documentation/guides/p2-claude-enablement-strategy.md`  
**Vision**: Transform any developer with Claude Code into a P2 programming expert through systematic knowledge transfer  
**Key Concepts**: 
- Knowledge multiplication (one expert → hundreds of capable developers)
- P2 Knowledge Package for Claude enhancement
- Breaking the low awareness → low demand cycle
**Integration**: Should become foundation for deliverables/developer-docs/ strategy and inform AI-reference structure

### 2. PROJECT-GOALS.md
**Location**: `engineering/operations/planning/strategic/PROJECT-GOALS.md`  
**Vision**: Enable progressive pedagogical consulting and production P2 code generation  
**Key Audiences**: AI Models, AI-Assisted P2 Developers  
**Goals**:
- Enable Progressive Pedagogical Consulting (40% weight)
- Enable Production P2 Code Generation (30% weight)
- Achieve 90% Trusted Coverage (30% weight)
**Integration**: Already in correct location, drives all project priorities

### 3. Documentation-Driven Market Development Strategy
**Location**: `pipelines/documentation-market-strategy.md`  
**Vision**: Each document type enables a specific market segment, systematically unlocking revenue streams  
**Market Segments**:
- Existing P2 Users (immediate impact)
- P1 Migration Market ($7 → $32 revenue uplift)
- Education Market (volume sales)
- AI/Embedded Developer Market
**Integration**: Should inform document production priorities in engineering/document-production/

### 4. AI Discovery Strategy
**Location**: `engineering/operations/planning/strategic/AI-DISCOVERY-STRATEGY.md`  
**Vision**: Make P2 documentation discoverable and consumable by AI systems  
**Strategies**:
- GitHub SEO & metadata optimization
- AI-ready documentation structure
- Machine-readable specifications
**Integration**: Already in correct location, should inform deliverables/ai-reference/ development

## Operational Strategy Documents

### 5. Model Switching Strategy
**Location**: `documentation/project-process/model-switching-strategy.md`  
**Vision**: Maximize quality while minimizing human interaction overhead through optimal AI model utilization  
**Key Principles**:
- Opus for creative/strategic work
- Sonnet for execution
- Haiku for simple tasks
**Integration**: Move to engineering/operations/claude-guidance/ as operational guidance

### 6. Claude Model Selection Strategy
**Location**: `pipelines/claude-model-selection-strategy.md`  
**Vision**: Cost-effective AI model usage aligned with task complexity  
**Framework**: Phase-based model selection for different project activities  
**Integration**: Should merge with Model Switching Strategy in engineering/operations/claude-guidance/

### 7. Demand-Driven Development Strategy
**Location**: `engineering/operations/planning/strategic/demand-driven-development-strategy.md`  
**Vision**: Transition from assumption-based to user-driven knowledge priorities  
**Key Concept**: Track actual user requests to prioritize development  
**Integration**: Already in correct location, should inform sprint planning

### 8. Project Information Architecture
**Location**: `engineering/operations/planning/strategic/project-information-architecture.md`  
**Vision**: Structure repository for multiple audience consumption patterns  
**Key Principle**: Audience-driven organization (AI, developers, learners, reference)  
**Integration**: Already in correct location, has driven current reorganization

## System Design Documents

### 9. Template Development and Automation Strategy
**Location**: `documentation/pdf-forge-system/template-development-and-automation-strategy.md`  
**Vision**: Streamline PDF generation through layered templates and automation  
**Key Concepts**: Foundation/content/presentation layers, automated testing  
**Integration**: Move to engineering/pdf-forge/guides/ as system documentation

### 10. AI Implementation Strategy
**Location**: `engineering/document-production/outbound/ai-presentation-materials-v1/ai-implementation-strategy.md`  
**Vision**: Progressive AI integration for P2 development support  
**Phases**: Knowledge base → AI assistance → Full automation  
**Integration**: Should inform deliverables/ai-reference/ development

### 11. Sprint Dependency Strategy
**Location**: `engineering/history/sprints/.sprints/sprint-dependency-strategy.md`  
**Vision**: Manage sprint dependencies to maximize parallel progress  
**Framework**: Dependency types and resolution strategies  
**Integration**: Historical reference, already in appropriate archive

### 12. Dual Pipeline Strategy
**Location**: `engineering/history/sprints/.sprints/dual-pipeline-strategy.md`  
**Vision**: Balance ingestion and production pipelines for continuous progress  
**Concept**: Parallel document ingestion and production workflows  
**Integration**: Historical reference, already in appropriate archive

## Integration Recommendations

### High Priority Integrations
1. **P2-Claude Enablement Strategy** → Create comprehensive introduction in deliverables/developer-docs/
2. **Documentation Market Strategy** → Use to prioritize document production queue
3. **Model Selection Strategies** → Consolidate into single guide in engineering/operations/claude-guidance/

### Section Overviews Needed
1. **deliverables/ai-reference/README.md** - Incorporate AI Discovery Strategy vision
2. **engineering/document-production/README.md** - Reference market strategy for prioritization
3. **engineering/operations/README.md** - Link to all strategic planning documents

### Documents to Move
- `documentation/project-process/model-switching-strategy.md` → `engineering/operations/claude-guidance/`
- `pipelines/claude-model-selection-strategy.md` → `engineering/operations/claude-guidance/`
- `pipelines/documentation-market-strategy.md` → `engineering/operations/planning/strategic/`
- `documentation/pdf-forge-system/template-development-and-automation-strategy.md` → `engineering/pdf-forge/guides/`

### Documents to Create
- **deliverables/README.md** - Public-facing overview incorporating enablement vision
- **engineering/operations/planning/strategic/README.md** - Index of all strategic documents
- **deliverables/developer-docs/VISION.md** - Extract vision elements for developers

## Notes

- Many vision documents are already correctly placed in strategic planning locations
- Some operational strategies are mixed with project vision and should be separated
- The P2-Claude Enablement Strategy is the most comprehensive vision document and should heavily influence public-facing content
- Market strategy documents provide concrete prioritization criteria for document production

*This catalog will be used in Phase 11 to integrate vision elements throughout the repository*
