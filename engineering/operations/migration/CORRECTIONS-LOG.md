# Migration Corrections Log

**Purpose**: Track corrections to misplaced files from the main reorganization
**Started**: 2025-09-01
**Process**: User identifies misplaced content → Document → Move → Update mapping.csv → Fix references

## Correction Process

1. **User identifies**: "X is in wrong place, should be in Y"
2. **Document here**: Record the correction details
3. **Update mapping.csv**: Add correction entry
4. **Execute move**: Use git mv
5. **Fix references**: Update any documents pointing to old location

## Corrections Queue

### Ready for Processing

**CORRECTION 1: Knowledge Base Structure**
- Current: `/engineering/knowledge-base/` contains loose .md files
- Action 1: Move `PASM2-DOCUMENTATION-CAPABILITY-ASSESSMENT.md` → `/engineering/document-production/analysis/`
- Action 2: Move `debt.md` → `/engineering/operations/technical-debt/`
- Action 3: Create `/engineering/knowledge-base/P1/` subdirectory
- Action 4: Create `/engineering/knowledge-base/P2/` subdirectory
- Action 5: Move `sources/sources/p1-master/*` → `/engineering/knowledge-base/P1/`
- Action 6: Move `sources/sources/pasm2-master/*` → `/engineering/knowledge-base/P2/`
- Rationale: Establish formal P1/P2 knowledge base structure side-by-side

### Completed Corrections

#### CORRECTION 1: Knowledge Base Structure (2025-09-01)
**Executed Successfully:**
- ✅ Moved `PASM2-DOCUMENTATION-CAPABILITY-ASSESSMENT.md` → `/engineering/document-production/analysis/`
- ✅ Moved `debt.md` → `/engineering/operations/technical-debt/`
- ✅ Created `/engineering/knowledge-base/P1/` subdirectory
- ✅ Created `/engineering/knowledge-base/P2/` subdirectory
- ✅ Moved `p1-master/*` → `/engineering/knowledge-base/P1/`
- ✅ Moved `pasm2-master/*` → `/engineering/knowledge-base/P2/`
- ✅ Updated mapping.csv with all moves
- **Result**: Formal P1/P2 knowledge base structure established side-by-side

#### CORRECTION 2: PASM2 Assessment Relocation (2025-09-01)
**Executed Successfully:**
- ✅ Moved `PASM2-DOCUMENTATION-CAPABILITY-ASSESSMENT.md` from `/engineering/document-production/analysis/` → `/engineering/knowledge-base/P2/`
- ✅ Removed empty `analysis/` directory
- ✅ Updated mapping.csv with move tracking
- **Rationale**: Document is a comprehensive audit of PASM2 knowledge across all sources, belongs with P2 knowledge base
- **Result**: P2 knowledge base now contains all P2 knowledge tracking documents together

## Notes

- Each correction gets a mapping.csv entry marked "correction"
- Preserves complete movement history
- Allows us to trace any file's journey through the reorganization
