## Verification Approach

For each use case:
1. **Create realistic scenario** with specific requirements
2. **Test AI guidance** against scenario
3. **Evaluate quality** of architectural recommendations
4. **Verify implementation** guidance leads to working system
5. **Assess teaching** effectiveness

Success is measured by:
- Quality of architectural recommendations
- Completeness of guidance
- Educational value
- Implementation success rate
