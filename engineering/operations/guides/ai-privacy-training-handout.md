# AI Privacy Training Handout - P2 Development

**Quick Reference Guide for Safe AI Usage in Propeller 2 Projects**  
*2-Page Workshop Summary*

## 🔒 Core Privacy Principles

### What's SAFE to Share with AI
✅ **Public algorithms & standard patterns**  
✅ **Educational examples & tutorials**  
✅ **Open source code & documentation**  
✅ **General P2 architecture concepts**  
✅ **Common hardware configurations**

### What to NEVER Share
🚫 **Credentials, API keys, passwords**  
🚫 **Customer data & personal information**  
🚫 **Proprietary algorithms & trade secrets**  
🚫 **Production system details**  
🚫 **Client-specific implementations**

### Exercise Caution With
⚠️ **Business logic & workflows**  
⚠️ **System configuration details**  
⚠️ **Error messages with paths/info**  
⚠️ **Performance & architecture data**

---

## 🛡️ Quick Sanitization Checklist

**Before sharing ANY code with AI:**
- [ ] Remove all credentials, API keys, secrets
- [ ] Replace sensitive variable/function names with generic ones
- [ ] Remove production URLs, IPs, file paths
- [ ] Replace real data with placeholder examples
- [ ] Generalize business-specific logic
- [ ] Check for embedded personal/customer data

**Example - Code Sanitization:**
```spin2
' BEFORE (sensitive)
PUB ConnectToClient(customer_id, api_secret) : result
  wifi.connect("ClientCorp-Prod", "RealPassword123")
  api.authenticate("sk-live-abcd1234")

' AFTER (sanitized)  
PUB ConnectToNetwork(device_id, auth_token) : result
  wifi.connect(network_name, network_password)
  api.authenticate(auth_token)
```

## ⚡ Safe P2 AI Usage Examples

### ✅ GOOD AI Prompts
```
"Generate PASM2 code to read Smart Pin 56 ADC values"
"Create SPIN2 method for I2C sensor communication"
"Help optimize this timing-critical assembly loop"
"Explain P2 COG memory model best practices"
"Generate boilerplate for motor control interface"
```

### ❌ AVOID These Prompts
```
"Debug our production system error: [real log data]"
"Here's our proprietary motor algorithm: [sensitive code]"
"Generate code for client's medical device specs"
"Help reverse-engineer competitor's product"
```

## 🏢 Organizational Guidelines

### Development Workflow
1. **Requirements** → Share high-level, sanitized functional needs
2. **Architecture** → Discuss general patterns, not specific systems  
3. **Code Generation** → Request non-sensitive function implementations
4. **Review & Test** → ALWAYS validate AI-generated code
5. **Integration** → Manually integrate with proprietary systems
6. **Documentation** → Mark AI-assisted sections clearly

### Team Responsibilities
- **Individual**: Each developer responsible for safe sharing
- **Team Lead**: Approve medium-risk AI usage
- **Management**: Policy for high-risk scenarios
- **Legal/Compliance**: Final authority on regulated data

### Risk Assessment
| Data Type | Risk | AI Usage | Approval |
|-----------|------|----------|----------|
| Public algorithms | Low | ✅ OK | None |
| Business logic | Medium | ⚠️ Review | Team lead |
| Proprietary secrets | High | 🚫 No | Executive |
| Regulated data | High | 🚫 No | Legal |

## 🚨 Incident Response

**If you accidentally share sensitive data:**
1. **STOP** the conversation immediately
2. **Document** what was shared and when
3. **Notify** manager/security team
4. **Check** AI service data retention policies
5. **Implement** additional safeguards
6. **Update** team training

## 📋 P2-Specific Best Practices

### Hardware Configuration Safety
- **Generic examples**: "Configure pins 0-7 as outputs"
- **Standard protocols**: I2C, SPI, UART implementations  
- **Common peripherals**: LEDs, sensors, motors
- **Educational projects**: Learning and tutorial code

### Avoid Sharing
- **Proprietary pinouts** & custom board layouts
- **Production configurations** & test procedures
- **Security implementations** & encryption keys
- **Client hardware** specifications

### Quality Standards
- **Always test** AI-generated P2 code before use
- **Follow standards** regardless of AI assistance
- **Document clearly** when AI was used
- **Maintain reviews** for all AI-assisted code

- **Technical Issues**: [Your development team lead]

### Key Reminders
🔸 **Think before sharing** - Is this sensitive?  
🔸 **Sanitize thoroughly** - Remove all identifying info  
🔸 **Test everything** - AI code needs validation  
🔸 **Document usage** - Note AI assistance clearly  
🔸 **Stay updated** - AI risks evolve constantly
