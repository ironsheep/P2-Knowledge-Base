## üîí Privacy Fundamentals

### What AI Systems Learn From Your Interactions

#### Immediate Context
- **Current conversation**: Everything you share in the current session
- **Code patterns**: Programming styles and architectural decisions
- **Requirements**: Functional and technical specifications you describe
- **Comments**: Any explanatory text you include with code

#### Persistent Learning (Service-Dependent)
- **Some AI services** may retain conversation history for training
- **Enterprise services** often provide data isolation guarantees
- **Local AI models** keep data on your systems
- **API services** vary in retention policies

### Data Classification Framework

#### ‚úÖ SAFE for AI Sharing
- **Public algorithms**: Standard implementations, common patterns
- **Educational examples**: Learning exercises and tutorial code
- **Open source code**: Already public repositories and libraries
- **Technical specifications**: Publicly available documentation
- **General architecture**: High-level system design concepts

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è EXERCISE CAUTION
- **Business logic**: Proprietary algorithms and workflows
- **Configuration details**: System-specific settings that could reveal architecture
- **Error messages**: May contain system information or file paths
- **Performance data**: Could reveal system capabilities or limitations
- **Third-party integrations**: Partner or vendor-specific code

#### üö´ NEVER SHARE
- **Credentials**: API keys, passwords, certificates, tokens
- **Personal data**: Customer information, employee details, private data
- **Proprietary secrets**: Trade secrets, competitive advantages
- **Security details**: Vulnerability information, access controls
- **Regulated data**: Healthcare, financial, or legally protected information
- **Client code**: Customer-specific implementations without permission

## üõ°Ô∏è Implementation Strategies

### Code Sanitization Techniques

#### Before Sharing with AI
```markdown
‚úÖ DO:
- Remove all credentials, API keys, and secrets
- Replace sensitive variable names with generic equivalents
- Use placeholder data instead of real datasets
- Generalize business-specific logic to conceptual examples
- Remove file paths that reveal system architecture

‚ùå DON'T:
- Share actual database schemas with real table names
- Include production configuration files
- Copy-paste error logs with system information
- Share complete codebases without review
- Upload files containing embedded credentials
```

#### Example: Code Sanitization
```spin2
' BEFORE (contains sensitive information)
PUB StartWifiConnection(ssid, password, api_key) : result
  ' Connect to CompanyNet-Production
  wifi.connect("CompanyNet-Prod", "SuperSecret123")
  api.authenticate("sk-prod-abcd1234efgh5678")
  customer_db.query("SELECT * FROM client_financial_data")

' AFTER (sanitized for AI sharing)
PUB StartWifiConnection(network_name, network_pass, auth_token) : result
  ' Connect to specified network
  wifi.connect(network_name, network_pass)
  api.authenticate(auth_token)
  database.query("SELECT * FROM sensor_data")
```

### Development Workflow Integration

#### Safe AI-Assisted Development Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Share high-level functional requirements (sanitized)
2. **Architecture Design**: Discuss general patterns and approaches
3. **Code Generation**: Request implementations for specific, non-sensitive functions
4. **Review and Validation**: Always test and verify AI-generated code
5. **Integration**: Manually integrate AI code with your proprietary systems
6. **Documentation**: Note AI assistance in code comments and documentation

#### Team Collaboration Guidelines
- **Establish policies**: Clear guidelines for what can be shared with AI
- **Training programs**: Educate team members on safe AI usage
- **Code review process**: Include AI-generated code in standard review workflows
- **Documentation standards**: Mark AI-assisted code sections clearly
- **Incident procedures**: What to do if sensitive data is accidentally shared
