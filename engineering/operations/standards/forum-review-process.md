## 🤖 Forum Scraping Strategy

### What We Scrape:
```python
# Pseudo-code for extraction
for post in thread:
    extract:
        - Username (for credits)
        - Date/time
        - Post content
        - Quoted sections (what they're responding to)
        - Code blocks (examples they provide)
    
    parse_for:
        - Section references ("On page 47..." "In the ADD instruction...")
        - Error reports ("This is wrong..." "Should be...")
        - Suggestions ("Would be better if...")
        - Questions ("Does this mean...?")
```

### Conversion to GitHub Issues:
```markdown
**Source**: Forum post by @username
**Date**: [Forum post date]
**Thread**: [Link to forum thread]
**Type**: [Error/Suggestion/Question]

**Section**: [Extracted reference]
