# P2 Knowledge Base Project Goals

*Established: 2025-08-19*  
*Review Quarterly*

## Our Audiences (Use These Terms Consistently)

- **AI Models** - AI systems that directly consume our repository for P2 knowledge
- **AI-Assisted P2 Developers** - Human developers using AI tools (Claude, Copilot, etc.) for P2 development

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1: Enable Progressive Pedagogical Consulting (40% Weight)

**Audience**: AI-Assisted P2 Developers (All Experience Levels)  
**Objective**: Provide adaptive tutoring that meets developers where they are and advances their P2 mastery

### Key Results:
- âœ… Support full experience spectrum: beginners â†’ migrants â†’ architects â†’ P2 veterans
- âœ… Progressive teaching frameworks (Smart Pin 3-stage progression as model)
- âœ… Expert-level tutoring for P2 veterans learning new capabilities
- âœ… Educational context detection and adaptive response
- âœ… Code analysis with improvement recommendations

### Why This Matters:
Every developer is a learner at some level. P2's richness requires expert tutoring to unlock its potential. We must teach, not just solve problems.

### Teaching Approach Examples:
- **Beginners**: "Let's make this LED blink and understand why each step matters"
- **Migrants**: "You know Arduino - here's how P2's 8 cogs change everything"
- **Veterans**: "You've mastered timing - let's explore how LUT memory could optimize your buffer management"
- **Experts**: "Looking at your code, CORDIC could replace these math routines for 10x speed improvement"

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2: Achieve 90% Trusted Knowledge Coverage (35% Weight)

**Audience**: AI Models (need trusted data)  
**Objective**: Move from 80% coverage to 90% GREEN (silicon-verified) coverage

### Key Results:
- âœ… All critical gaps (RED items) eliminated
- âœ… Yellow (unverified) items validated or corrected
- âœ… Silicon-verified behaviors documented
- âœ… Trust indicators clear throughout documentation

### Why This Matters:
AI Models need trustworthy information to generate reliable code. Unverified knowledge leads to bugs.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal 3: Establish Predictable Sprint Velocity (25% Weight)

**Audience**: Internal team productivity  
**Objective**: Consistent, sustainable progress through defined sprints

### Key Results:
- âœ… Complete one focused sprint per week
- âœ… Decision matrix guides sprint selection
- âœ… Clean handoffs between sprints
- âœ… Reduced friction and increased velocity over time

### Why This Matters:
Sustainable velocity means predictable delivery for both audiences.

## How Goals Drive Decisions

1. **Sprint Selection**: Decision matrix weights options against these goals
2. **Task Priority**: Work that serves Goal 1 > Goal 2 > Goal 3
3. **Resource Allocation**: Time and effort proportional to goal weights
4. **Success Metrics**: Measure progress against key results

## Goal Review Triggers

Review and adjust goals when:
- Major milestone achieved (e.g., 90% coverage reached)
- External factors change (community needs, P2 updates)
- Quarterly review period
- Strategic pivot needed

*These goals guide all project decisions. When in doubt, check alignment with goals.*
