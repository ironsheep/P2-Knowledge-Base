# Sprint Planning Process - Technical Debt Integration

**Philosophy**: Proactive debt resolution aligned with sprint goals  
**Key Insight**: Document sprints require **early** visual asset planning  

## Sprint Type Classification

### ðŸ”´ **Document Sprint** (Creating new manuals/guides)
**Process**: Technical debt review happens **EARLY** in planning phase

#### Pre-Sprint Planning (Week before)
1. **Identify document scope** and target content
2. **Pull forward visual requirements** from technical debt
3. **Early asset capture** - Stephen captures needed images
4. **Asset preparation** - Images ready before document creation starts
5. **Sprint launch** with all visual dependencies resolved

**Example - V1.1 Smart Pins Manual Sprint**:
```
Week -1: Smart Pins Manual planned
â”œâ”€â”€ Review VISUAL-ASSETS-DEBT.md for Smart Pin diagrams
â”œâ”€â”€ Pull forward: "Smart Pin Block Diagram" debt item  
â”œâ”€â”€ Stephen captures: Smart Pin configuration screenshots
â”œâ”€â”€ Prepare: Smart Pin timing diagrams from docs
â””â”€â”€ Sprint starts: All Smart Pin visuals ready for manual creation
```

### ðŸŸ¡ **Enhancement Sprint** (Improving existing content)
**Process**: Standard technical debt review at sprint start

#### Sprint Start
1. **Review technical debt inventory** 
2. **Select enhancement-aligned debt items**
3. **Integrate with planned improvements**
4. **Execute with mixed debt/enhancement work**

### ðŸŸ¢ **Infrastructure Sprint** (Tools, processes, automation)
**Process**: Infrastructure debt prioritized

#### Sprint Focus
1. **Review infrastructure debt**
2. **Select build/process improvements**
3. **Address automation gaps**
4. **Improve development velocity**

## Document Sprint Deep Dive

### Phase 1: Document Definition (Pre-Sprint)
```
Document Goal: Terminal Window Manual
â†“
Search Technical Debt: "terminal", "scope", "debug output"
â†“  
Pull Forward Debt Items:
- DEBUG Terminal Output screenshots
- SCOPE Display examples  
- Color palette demonstrations
- Multi-window layouts
â†“
Asset Capture Plan: Stephen's priority list
â†“
Sprint Ready: All visuals prepared
```

### Phase 2: Sprint Execution  
```
Week 1: Document creation with visuals
Week 2: Content refinement and integration
Week 3: Professional PDF generation
Week 4: Release preparation
```

### Phase 3: Debt Resolution Tracking
```
Completed Debt Items:
âœ… DEBUG Terminal Output â†’ Terminal Window Manual
âœ… SCOPE Displays â†’ Terminal Window Manual
âœ… Multi-window examples â†’ Terminal Window Manual

New Debt Discovered:
ðŸ”´ Advanced SCOPE triggering modes (add to debt)
ðŸ”´ Terminal color customization options (add to debt)
```

## Planning Process by Sprint Type

### Document Sprint Planning Sequence

#### 1. Document Requirements Analysis (T-2 weeks)
- Define manual scope and audience
- Identify required visual content
- Map to existing technical debt items

#### 2. Visual Debt Pull-Forward (T-1 week)  
- Extract relevant debt from VISUAL-ASSETS-DEBT.md
- Create capture priority list for Stephen
- Schedule asset capture session
- Prepare placeholders if needed

#### 3. Asset Capture & Preparation (T-1 week)
- Stephen captures prioritized screenshots
- Images processed and organized
- Placeholders replaced with real assets
- Visual content ready for integration

#### 4. Sprint Launch (T-0)
- All visual dependencies resolved
- Document creation can proceed unblocked
- Focus on content quality and integration

### Enhancement Sprint Planning Sequence

#### 1. Standard Debt Review (Sprint start)
- Review all technical debt categories
- Assess sprint capacity and theme alignment
- Select complementary debt items

#### 2. Integration Planning
- Weave debt resolution into enhancement work
- Avoid scope creep with clear boundaries
- Maintain sprint focus while addressing debt

### Infrastructure Sprint Planning Sequence

#### 1. Infrastructure Debt Focus
- Prioritize build system improvements
- Address automation gaps
- Improve documentation velocity

#### 2. Foundation Building
- Tools that enable future document sprints
- Processes that reduce manual overhead
- Systems that prevent future debt accumulation

## Debt Categories by Sprint Type

### Document Sprints â†’ Visual Assets Debt
**Primary Focus**: Images, diagrams, screenshots needed for manual creation
**Pull-Forward Items**: Any visual content required for planned document
**Timeline**: Asset capture 1 week before sprint start

### Enhancement Sprints â†’ Content Gaps Debt  
**Primary Focus**: Missing sections, incomplete explanations, accuracy improvements
**Selection Criteria**: Aligns with enhancement theme
**Timeline**: Standard sprint start integration

### Infrastructure Sprints â†’ Process Debt
**Primary Focus**: Build automation, template systems, workflow improvements  
**Selection Criteria**: Improves development velocity
**Timeline**: Full sprint dedication to infrastructure

## Example Sprint Sequences

### V1.1 Sprint: Smart Pins Manual

## Success Metrics

### Document Sprint Success
- **Visual Readiness**: 100% of required images available at sprint start
- **Content Quality**: Professional manual with integrated visuals
- **Debt Resolution**: Planned debt items completed within sprint
- **New Debt**: Discovered gaps added to debt inventory

### Process Improvement  
- **Lead Time**: Reduced time from planning to execution
- **Quality**: Higher manual quality with integrated visuals
- **Efficiency**: Less rework due to missing assets
- **Sustainability**: Sustainable asset capture workflow

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Updated Release Workflow
```
1. Sprint Type Classification
2. Technical Debt Review (timing varies by type)
3. Asset Pull-Forward (for document sprints)
4. Sprint Execution  
5. Debt Status Update
6. Release Preparation
```

### Tool Integration
- **Technical debt files** feed into sprint planning
- **Visual asset inventory** drives capture priorities  
- **Completion tracking** maintains debt status
- **Sprint retrospectives** improve debt management

---

**Process Philosophy**: Proactive debt management enables higher quality deliverables by ensuring dependencies are resolved before they become blockers. Document sprints especially benefit from early visual asset preparation.

**Next Application**: V1.1 sprint planning will test this enhanced process with Smart Pins Manual as the target document.
