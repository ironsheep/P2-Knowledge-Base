## Overview

Effective model management maximizes quality while minimizing human interaction overhead. This document captures our strategy for optimal model utilization.

## Model Capabilities

### Opus 4.1
**Strengths**:
- Creative and narrative work
- Voice analysis and replication
- Pedagogical design
- Strategic planning
- Complex synthesis
- User-facing documentation

**When to Use**:
- Manual/guide creation
- Teaching material development
- Voice/style analysis
- Strategic planning sessions
- Complex problem solving
- Beginning of planning cycles

### Sonnet 4
**Strengths**:
- Technical analysis
- Code extraction
- Data processing
- Systematic organization
- Following templates
- Bulk operations

**When to Use**:
- Extraction tasks
- Audit processes
- Matrix creation
- Code cataloging
- Technical validation
- Extended work sessions

### Haiku 3.5
**Strengths**:
- Simple queries
- Quick validations
- Basic formatting
- Status checks

**When to Use**:
- Simple file operations
- Quick status reports
- Basic validation
- Cost optimization for simple tasks

## Switching Principles

### 1. Minimize Switches
**Why**: Each switch requires human interaction
**How**: 
- Batch work by model
- Plan execution order
- Complete model-specific work before switching

### 2. Daily Rhythm
**Morning Window**:
- Opus typically available at day start
- Use for creative/strategic work
- Maximize this window for Opus-requiring tasks

**Extended Work**:
- Switch to Sonnet for longer sessions
- More sustainable for extended work
- Reserve Opus for specific needs

### 3. Sprint Planning
**During Planning**:
- Identify model needs per item
- Document in sprint plan
- Create advisory execution order
- Feed forward to task generation

**Example from Sprint 005**:
```
Items 1,2,4,5: Sonnet 4 (technical work)
Item 3 Phase 1: Sonnet 4 (extraction)
Item 3 Phase 2-3: Opus 4.1 (voice/creative)
Item 3 Phase 4: Sonnet 4 (validation)

Optimal: Do 1,2,4,5 then switch once for Item 3
```

## Planning Considerations

### Work Classification

**Always Needs Opus**:
- User documentation generation
- Teaching material creation
- Voice/style analysis
- Strategic planning
- Creative synthesis

**Can Use Sonnet**:
- Technical extraction
- Systematic audits
- Matrix generation
- Code cataloging
- Following established patterns

**Could Use Haiku**:
- Simple file operations
- Basic status checks
- Quick validations

### Batching Strategy

**Principles**:
1. Group all Opus work together
2. Group all Sonnet work together
3. Execute Opus work when model available
4. Default to Sonnet for extended sessions

**Sprint Level**:
- Order items by model requirement
- Minimize total switches
- Consider dependencies
- Document in plan

**Daily Level**:
- Assess available work
- Check model availability
- Batch similar work
- Switch deliberately

---

## Communication

### In Planning Documents
```markdown
**Model Strategy Advisory**:
- Primary work in Sonnet 4 (Items 1, 2, 4, 5)
- Switch to Opus 4.1 only for Item 3 creative phases
- Minimize model switches (human interaction required)
```

### To Task Generation
- Tag tasks by required model
- Suggest batching opportunities
- Note dependencies
- Provide optimization hints

### During Execution
- Announce planned switches
- Batch work before switching
- Complete current model's work
- Switch purposefully

---

## Cost Considerations

### Relative Costs (Approximate)
- Opus 4.1: Baseline (1x)
- Sonnet 4: ~33% of Opus
- Haiku 3.5: ~10% of Opus

### Optimization Strategies
- Use Opus for high-value creative work
- Use Sonnet for bulk technical work
- Use Haiku for simple operations
- Justify Opus use by output value

---

## Practical Patterns

### Pattern 1: Documentation Sprint
```
Morning (Opus available):
- Create/refine user guides
- Develop teaching materials
- Analyze voice/style

Afternoon (Switch to Sonnet):
- Extract technical details
- Build matrices
- Catalog examples
```

### Pattern 2: Technical Sprint
```
Full day (Sonnet):
- All extraction work
- All audit work
- All cataloging
- Save Opus needs for another day
```

### Pattern 3: Mixed Sprint
```
Start (Sonnet):
- Complete all technical work
- Build foundations

Single Switch (Opus):
- Creative synthesis
- Guide generation

Return (Sonnet):
- Validation
- Cleanup
```

## Decision Framework

### When Planning Work
Ask:
1. Does this need creative synthesis? → Opus
2. Is this following a template? → Sonnet
3. Is this simple/mechanical? → Haiku
4. Can we batch similar work? → Yes
5. When is model available? → Plan accordingly

### When Switching
Ensure:
1. Current model's work complete
2. Switch is justified
3. Next model's work is batched
4. Human is available for switch

## Advisory Notes

**Remember**:
- These are guidelines, not rules
- Execution has freedom to optimize
- Document actual switches for learning
- Every sprint improves our understanding

**Key Insight**:
"We don't spend a lot of time in Opus during normal work"
- Reserve Opus for high-value tasks
- Default to Sonnet for sustainability
- Switch deliberately and purposefully
