# Integration Notes: SPRINT-DOCUMENT-LIFECYCLE.md

## What We Took

1. **Compaction Safety Pattern**
   - Concept of `tasks/active/` folder that survives compaction
   - Quick recovery pointer to current work
   - Clear recovery commands after context loss

2. **Working vs Archive State**
   - Distinction between active work and completed reference
   - Completion artifacts for comparison

3. **Explicit Completion Documents**
   - Sprint summary at completion
   - Retrospective documentation
   - Clear end-state artifacts

---

## What We Adapted

1. **Simplified Structure**
   - Used our existing `.sprints/` instead of their `DOCs/project-sprints/`
   - Single location instead of copying between folders
   - Cleaner, less movement

2. **Living Documents**
   - Our plans can evolve during execution
   - Updates captured in place
   - Version control shows evolution

3. **Integration Approach**
   - Deep integration with MCP todo system
   - Context keys for state preservation
   - Git integration for history

4. **Recovery Pattern**
   - Combined with our `context_resume` pattern
   - Simpler pointer file instead of full copies
   - Less file management overhead

---

## What We Left

1. **Complex File Copying**
   - Their `cp` commands between folders
   - File movement workflow
   - Redundant copies

2. **Rigid Separation**
   - Their DOCs/ vs tasks/ split
   - Over-structured approach
   - Too many locations

3. **Frozen Documents**
   - Their "never modify after creation" rule
   - Prevents learning integration
   - Against our living document philosophy

4. **Prescriptive Naming**
   - Their SPRINT_1_ACTIVE.md convention
   - ALL_CAPS naming style
   - Rigid structure

---

## Why These Choices

### Simplification
We already have a good structure with `.sprints/`. Adding complexity through file copying doesn't add value for our use case.

### Living Documents
Our philosophy of continuous improvement means documents should evolve. Freezing them prevents integration of learnings.

### Tool Integration
We have MCP todo and context systems that handle much of what their file movement tried to solve.

### Practicality
Less file management = less overhead = more focus on actual work.

---

## Result

Created `sprint-document-lifecycle.md` that:
- Incorporates compaction safety
- Maintains our simpler structure
- Integrates with our tools
- Preserves our living document philosophy
- Provides clear lifecycle without complexity

---

## Lessons Learned

1. External patterns often solve problems we don't have
2. Simplification during adaptation is valuable
3. Our existing structure was already good
4. Compaction safety was the key insight worth taking
