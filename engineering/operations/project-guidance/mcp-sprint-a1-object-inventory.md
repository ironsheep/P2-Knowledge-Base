# MCP: Sprint A1 - P2 Object Inventory and Categorization

## 1. Task Overview

**Objective**: Create comprehensive inventory of all available P2 code objects with metadata, attribution, and quality indicators to enable systematic pattern extraction.

**Context**: This sprint unblocks all pattern extraction work (P1, P2, P3). We need to know what code exists before we can analyze it for patterns. The GitHub repo contains the pre-OBEX seed data, representing community practices before formal curation.

**Success Criteria**:
- All P2 objects from GitHub repo catalogued with metadata
- Author/copyright attribution documented (where available)  
- Functional categorization complete (display, sensor, protocol, etc.)
- Quality/usability indicators identified
- Compilation compatibility noted (where determinable)
- Master inventory file ready for pattern extraction teams

**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours (240 minutes)

## 2. Prerequisites & Dependencies

**Must Complete First**: 
- Sprint F1: Source Truth Establishment âœ… (Complete)
- Access to GitHub repository established

**Required Resources**:
- GitHub repo: `https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller/tree/master/libraries/community/p2/All`
- Local clone or web access to repository
- Spreadsheet/database for inventory tracking
- Text analysis tools for metadata extraction

**Knowledge Prerequisites**:
- Understanding of P2 object structure (.spin2 files)
- Basic knowledge of SPIN2/PASM2 to assess code quality
- Familiarity with P2 hardware categories (displays, sensors, etc.)

## 3. Detailed Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Repository Access and Structure Analysis (30 min)
1. **Clone Repository** (if not already available)
   - Clone: `git clone https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller.git`
   - Navigate to: `libraries/community/p2/All/`
   - Count total objects: `ls -1 | wc -l`

2. **Initial Structure Survey**
   - List all object directories
   - Note file types present (.spin2, .pasm2, .md, etc.)
   - Identify any obvious subcategorization
   - Check for README files or documentation

### Phase 2: Object Metadata Extraction (90 min)
For each object directory:

1. **Basic Metadata**
   - Object name (directory name)
   - Primary file types (.spin2, .pasm2, mixed)
   - File count and total size
   - Last modified date (from git history if available)

2. **Attribution Mining**
   - Check file headers for author information
   - Look for copyright notices
   - Extract license information (MIT is default)
   - Note git commit authors if different from code authors

3. **Functional Analysis**
   - Read primary .spin2 file or README for functionality description
   - Identify hardware requirements (pins, external components)
   - Categorize by function:
     - **Display**: VGA, HDMI, LCD, LED matrices
     - **Sensor**: Environmental, motion, optical  
     - **Communication**: I2C, SPI, UART, wireless
     - **Motor Control**: Servo, stepper, DC motors
     - **Audio**: Synthesis, playback, processing
     - **Protocol**: Low-level communication drivers
     - **Utility**: Math, formatting, general purpose
     - **Mixed**: Multi-function objects

### Phase 3: Quality Assessment (60 min)
For each object, evaluate:

1. **Code Quality Indicators**
   - Documentation completeness (comments, README)
   - Method organization and naming
   - Error handling present/absent
   - Use of standard P2 conventions

2. **Usability Assessment**
   - Clear interface (public methods well-defined)
   - Configuration flexibility
   - Example usage provided
   - Hardware dependencies clearly stated

3. **Compilation Notes**
   - Primary language (SPIN2, PASM2, mixed)
   - FlexSpin compatibility indicators
   - PropellerTool compatibility indicators
   - External dependencies noted

### Phase 4: Categorization and Organization (45 min)
1. **Create Category Groupings**
   - Group objects by primary function
   - Identify objects that fit multiple categories
   - Note relationships between objects (dependencies, alternatives)

2. **Quality Tiers**
   - **Tier 1**: Well-documented, clear interface, standard conventions
   - **Tier 2**: Functional but minimal documentation
   - **Tier 3**: Code-only, requires analysis to understand
   - **Tier 4**: Incomplete or problematic code

3. **Priority Ranking for Pattern Analysis**
   - High: Tier 1 objects with common functionality
   - Medium: Tier 2 objects filling important niches  
   - Low: Tier 3/4 or very specialized objects

### Phase 5: Documentation and Validation (15 min)
1. **Generate Master Inventory**
   - Create structured data file (CSV/JSON)
   - Include all extracted metadata
   - Cross-reference categorizations

2. **Quality Check**
   - Verify no objects missed
   - Check categorization consistency
   - Validate attribution completeness

## 4. Source Information

**Primary Data Source**: 
- GitHub: `https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller/tree/master/libraries/community/p2/All`
- Web interface for browsing: Use GitHub web interface for initial survey
- Git clone for detailed analysis: `git clone https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller.git`

**Reference Documentation**:
- P2 Object structure: `./documentation-standards/`
- Attribution standards: `./documentation-standards/instruction-documentation-template.md`
- Pattern recognition framework: `./documentation-standards/p2-idiom-extraction-framework.md`

**Examples of Similar Work**:
- Our PASM2 instruction cataloguing with lineage tracking
- Software library analysis methodologies

## 5. Expected Outputs

**Primary Deliverables**:
- `p2-object-inventory.csv` - Master inventory with all metadata
- `p2-object-categories.md` - Category definitions and groupings
- `p2-object-quality-assessment.md` - Quality tiers and usability notes

**Secondary Outputs**:
- `attribution-issues.md` - Objects with missing/unclear attribution
- `compilation-compatibility.md` - Notes on tool compatibility
- `pattern-analysis-priorities.md` - Recommended order for pattern extraction

**Storage Location**: `./sources/analysis/`

**Naming Convention**:
- Prefix with date: `20250814-p2-object-inventory.csv`
- Include version if iterations needed: `p2-categories-v2.md`

## 6. Integration Requirements

**Handoffs**:
- Pattern extraction teams (P1, P2, P3) need inventory for object selection
- AI training team needs quality tiers for example prioritization
- Community documentation team needs attribution data

**Dependencies This Creates**:
- Unblocks Sprint P1 (Structural Pattern Mining)
- Unblocks Sprint P2 (Communication Pattern Mining)  
- Unblocks Sprint P3 (Hardware Interface Patterns)
- Enables Sprint A2 (OBEX Evolution Analysis)

**Update Requirements**:
- Add inventory location to main README
- Update sprint dependency tracking
- Notify pattern extraction teams when complete

**Communication**:
- Post completion summary with key statistics
- Highlight any surprising findings or issues discovered
- Recommend priority objects for first pattern analysis

## 7. Risk Mitigation

**Common Pitfalls**:
- **Attribution Ambiguity**: Some objects may have unclear authorship
  - *Mitigation*: Document uncertainty, note "attribution unclear" rather than guessing
- **Functional Categorization Overlap**: Objects serving multiple purposes  
  - *Mitigation*: Use primary + secondary categories, document multi-function objects
- **Quality Assessment Subjectivity**: Code quality evaluation may be inconsistent
  - *Mitigation*: Use objective criteria (documentation presence, method organization)

**Fallback Plans**:
- **If GitHub access fails**: Use web interface for manual cataloguing
- **If repository too large**: Start with subset of highest-priority categories
- **If attribution impossible**: Focus on functional analysis, note attribution limits

**Escalation Path**:
- Technical issues: Check with user about repository access methods
- Categorization questions: Document ambiguous cases for community input
- Quality assessment disputes: Use conservative tier assignments

**Time Management**:
- **Scope Management**: If taking too long, prioritize Tier 1 objects first
- **Perfectionism Check**: Remember this enables pattern extraction, not final documentation
- **Progress Tracking**: Update TodoWrite at each phase completion

## 8. Success Indicators

**Quantitative Goals**:
- 100% of P2 objects catalogued (expect 25-50 objects based on initial survey)
- 90%+ objects categorized by function
- 75%+ objects have quality tier assignment
- Attribution documented where available (expect 60-80% coverage)

**Quality Gates**:
- Inventory validates against directory listing (no objects missed)
- Categories have balanced distribution (no single category >50% of objects)
- Quality tiers follow objective criteria consistently
- Attribution follows established lineage standards

**Completion Validation**:
- Random sample of 5 objects can be quickly located using inventory
- Categories enable efficient pattern extraction team assignments
- Quality tiers allow prioritization of analysis effort
- Output formats ready for next sprint consumption
