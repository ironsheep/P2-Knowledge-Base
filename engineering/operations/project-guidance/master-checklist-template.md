# Master Checklist (MCP) Template

## Purpose
Master Checklists provide complete context for task execution, eliminating questions and setup delays.

## MCP Structure

### 1. Task Overview
- **Objective**: What exactly are we accomplishing?
- **Context**: Why is this important? How does it fit the bigger picture?
- **Success Criteria**: How do we know we're done?
- **Estimated Effort**: Realistic time/complexity assessment

### 2. Prerequisites & Dependencies  
- **Must Complete First**: Specific tasks that block this work
- **Required Resources**: Files, tools, access permissions needed
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: What someone needs to know before starting

### 3. Detailed Execution Plan
- **Step-by-Step Process**: Concrete actions in logical order
- **Decision Points**: Where choices need to be made and criteria for decisions
- **Quality Gates**: Checkpoints to validate progress
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### 4. Source Information
- **Reference Documents**: Links to all relevant documentation
- **Data Sources**: Where to find required input data
- **Examples**: Similar work done previously
- **Expert Contacts**: Who to ask if stuck

### 5. Expected Outputs
- **Primary Deliverables**: Main files/documents to create
- **Secondary Outputs**: Metadata, logs, documentation to generate
- **Storage Locations**: Where outputs should be saved
- **Naming Conventions**: How to name files consistently

### 6. Integration Requirements
- **Handoffs**: Who needs the outputs and in what format
- **Dependencies This Creates**: What tasks this unblocks
- **Update Requirements**: Other documents/systems to update
- **Communication**: Who to notify when complete

### 7. Risk Mitigation
- **Common Pitfalls**: What typically goes wrong
- **Fallback Plans**: Alternative approaches if blocked
- **Escalation Path**: Who to contact for major issues
- **Time Management**: How to avoid scope creep

## Benefits of MCPs

1. **Immediate Productivity**: No ramp-up time when switching tasks
2. **Consistent Quality**: Standardized approach across all work  
3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture planning insights for future use
4. **Risk Reduction**: Anticipate and prepare for common problems
5. **Scalability**: Others can execute tasks using the same checklist

## MCP vs Regular Task

**Regular Task**: "Analyze P2 objects for patterns"

**MCP Version**: Complete context including:
- Which specific objects to analyze (with file paths)
- What pattern types to extract (with examples)
- Tools and scripts to use (with setup instructions)  
- Output format requirements (with templates)
- Quality validation steps (with criteria)
- Integration with existing knowledge base
- Common analysis pitfalls to avoid
