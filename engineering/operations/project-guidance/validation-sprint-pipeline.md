# Validation Sprint Pipeline

**Purpose**: Track canonical source code studies for strategic foundation enhancement  
**Strategy**: Use these sprints to "level up" understanding at optimal moments

## ðŸ“Š PIPELINE MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

### When to Execute Validation Sprints:
1. **Knowledge Gap Identified**: When we need deeper understanding of specific patterns
2. **Quality Enhancement**: Before major document releases for canonical examples
3. **Validation Need**: To verify our foundation understanding is accurate
4. **Learning Opportunity**: When time allows for deep study

### Integration with Document Generation:
- **Not Sequential**: Don't need to do all validation before documents
- **Strategic Placement**: Insert where they add most value
- **Parallel Execution**: Can run while other work proceeds
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Documents improve as we learn

### Success Criteria for Each Sprint:
- Can Claude understand and explain the code?
- Are canonical patterns identified and documented?
- Do insights enhance our foundation knowledge?
- Can we generate better P2 code after studying it?

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITY

### AI Foundation Validation Sprint (Runtime Interpreter)
**Why Now**:
- Foundation complete (PASM2 + Silicon + SPIN2)
- Ready for validation testing
- Provides canonical examples for document generation
- Independent execution possible

**Execution Model**:
1. Plan with question exhaustion method
2. Generate detailed MCP tasks
3. Execute independently while user on other projects
4. Deliver pattern documentation and validation results
