    description_full: The Gauge Object provides a simple gauge face method for use
      with the Graphics Object by the top object. It handles some common overhead
      issues such as scaling, fitting within the screen, converting readings to degrees
      and uniform handling of colors. It uses default values but allows customization.
      The resulting bitmap can be displayed by the TV.SRC or VGA.SRC driver called
      by the top object. By using multiple copies of the object, many gauges can easily
      be drawn with minimum effort.
