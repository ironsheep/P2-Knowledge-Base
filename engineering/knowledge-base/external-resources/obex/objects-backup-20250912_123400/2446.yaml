    description_full: This is a modular controller for 1 or more paralleled MCP3201
      ADC chips. Currently sampling about 100Ksps, it is intended to run as many ADCs
      as there are open cogs. On a single prop, that is N-2 for 6 parallel devices.
      with some trickery and using the common timing from the initial clockgenmodule,
      multiple props could be ganged together indefinitely using all 8 cogs in each.
      (assuming the acqmod is replacing cog 0).
