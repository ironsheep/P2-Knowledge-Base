    description_full: I've gotten my assembly language version of my ADS7822P driver
      running this version will do up to approx. 100000 8 bit conversions per second
      while meeting the minimum timing requirements of the data sheetOr if you need
      more precision you can get approx. 75000 12 bit conversions per second.The object
      can be used as- a pure spin object - much slower but does not tie up a cog-
      an assembly language implementation - FASTThe documentation is in the spin files.
