    description_full: This is a driver for the Dynamixel AX12+ digital servos. It
      now allows all settings including baud rate (7.843k to 1m) to be set. It now
      allows setting continuous rotation or servo mode. When writing to a 2 byte control
      register i.e. moving speed, goal position, etc., write the value (up to 11bits)
      to the first byte address of the 2 byte control register and the program will
      automatically write the low/high bytes for you when using the writedata method.
      Example file shows use.
