    description_full: This PST application uses the HM55B_Dual_Driver object. This
      dual SPI driver object can control two HM55B 2-axis compass modules that may
      form a 3-axis magnetometer unit. The driver can be used in a single sensor setup,
      as well. It needs only one additional COG for its PASM code for both sensors.
