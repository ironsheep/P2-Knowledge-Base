    description_full: "This program receives and parses a DMX-512A data stream. DMX\
      \ is a protocol for controlling lighting equipment and accessories. This program\
      \ is based on information gathered around the web related to ANSI E1.11 \u201A\
      \xC4\xEC 2004: Entertainment Technology - USITT DMX512-A - Asynchronous Serial\
      \ Digital Data Transmission Standard for Controlling Lighting Equipment and\
      \ Accessories. This program captures all 513 slots of data (1 start byte and\
      \ 512 data bytes) but also recognizes if a short packet is transmitted. This\
      \ is an assembly language driver that is highly commented. The program runs\
      \ in its own cog. Included is a simple demo file, but the demo code is not all\
      \ that functional and rather short."
