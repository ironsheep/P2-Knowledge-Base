    description_full: Easily control several 74HC595 shift registers in series. Now
      includes a variation which leaves out the PWM feature and instead supports up
      to 100 chips! Still also includes the multi-PWM driver, which allows you to
      set PWM frequency and duty cycle for any or all of 32 outputs. The PWM driver
      remembers whether you've set an output to PWM or a steady high or low value,
      and manages the PWM outputs for you automatically. Also includes the version
      1.0 Simple_74HC595 object for those who just want to understand how to shift
      data out to the 74HC595 chip.
