    description_full: A full duplex serial that has ALL the buffer memory stored in
      the COG. The VAR footprint is tiny at only 6 longs. The buffer pointers are
      fully automatic, which allows easy access from assembly as well as sub-objects.
      The buffer sizes may be set at any number of bytes (in multiples of 4) to the
      total spare capacity of the COG (a bit over 1300 bytes). Only mode 0 is supported,
      with baud rates to above 345600 for a 80MHz clock.
