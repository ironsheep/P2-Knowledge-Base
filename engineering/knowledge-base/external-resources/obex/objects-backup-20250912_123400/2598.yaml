    description_full: Pasm I2C Driver - This is an assembly version of Mike Green's
      Basic I2C Driver. This object uses the same calling interface so that it can
      be used in any project that currently uses the Basic I2C Driver. It provides
      a substantial improvement in speed over the Spin-only driver, and is usefull
      for accessing EEPROMs at higher speed. The constant, DELAY_CYCLES should be
      adjusted to provide the desired bus clocking speed.
