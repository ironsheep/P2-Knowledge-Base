    description_full: Decodes a 2-bit rotary quadrature encoder and stores the encoder's
      position as a variable in hub ram. This is a very simple object which can read
      only one decoder at a time, but illustrates the concept well and should be easy
      for beginners to understand. Includes demo program.
