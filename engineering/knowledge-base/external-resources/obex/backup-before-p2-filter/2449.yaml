    description_full: Pulsadis is a remote control system using electric power distribution
      lines as physical support. It's mainly used ine Europe and particularly in Belgium
      and France to control public lighting, low/high rates periods, etc. This project
      detects Pulsadis frames and stores them on a memory card for further processing.
      It may also extremely easily control Leds, relays, ... Just a few cheap hardware
      components are required.
