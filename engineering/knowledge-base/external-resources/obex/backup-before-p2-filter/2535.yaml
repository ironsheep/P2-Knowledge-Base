    description_full: 'between two or more Propeller chips. This interface is very

      loosely based on the MIL-STD-1553 interface. One chip becomes the

      Bus Controller (BC) and all others are Remote Terminals (RT).

      The interface uses a single wire, bi-directional bus. The data

      is transferred using Manchester encoding at a 1MBit data rate.

      All data consist of 16 bit words.'
