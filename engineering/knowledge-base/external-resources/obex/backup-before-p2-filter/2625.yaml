    description_full: This object generates a 1024x768 VGA signal which contains 128
      columns x 64 rows of 8x12 characters. Each row can have a unique forground/background
      color combination and each character can be inversed. There are also two cursors
      which can be independently controlled (ie. mouse and keyboard). A sync indicator
      signals each time the screen is refreshed (you may ignore).
