    description_full: The Nintendo Wii's controller called the Wiimote contains a
      small IR camera with I2C interface. This camera can track the position of 4
      points of light (IR if filter is used, visible if removed.) This can be used
      for many applications such as 3D scanning, head tracking, multi-touch screens,
      robot targeting, range finding. The object runs in a cog and can be used using
      simple helper functions, there are several demos and the main object is well
      documented. All you need for hardware is the wiimote camera and a pull up resisitor.
