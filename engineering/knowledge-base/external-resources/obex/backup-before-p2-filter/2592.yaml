    description_full: This serial driver allows loading of programs wirelessly to
      EEPROM, with the Kermit protocol. Tested on XBee in transparent mode. Requires
      a program such as Hyperterminal (PC) or ZTerm (Mac) to send the file. Also implements
      a command line interface. Program loading not real fast, takes about 1.5 minutes
      to load a 32K .eeprom file. Also allows printing to the serial connection for
      logging, etc. 'Extra' files have VGA debug display version and command parser
      routine.
