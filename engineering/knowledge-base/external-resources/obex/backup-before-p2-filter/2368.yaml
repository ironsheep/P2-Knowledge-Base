    description_full: See notes for "MCP3208_fast" object. Allows support of up to
      24 ADC channels with one object. Supports up to three MCP3208 ADC chips with
      fast access and fast averages to any one of the 24 ADC channels. All calculations
      done in assembly code. Uses same fast algorithms as those coded in MCP3208_fast.
      See code for description and calling sequence.
