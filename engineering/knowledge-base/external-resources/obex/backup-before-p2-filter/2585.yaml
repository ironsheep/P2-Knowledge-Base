    description_full: 'A stand-alone writer, requiring one cog

      A stand-alone reader that reads up to 1Mbps but requires two cogs

      A stand-alone reader that reads up to 500Kbps but only requires one cog

      A combined reader/writer that operates at 500Kbps, requires one cog but works
      haltingly on high-traffic busses

      And a demonstration showing how everything works together'
