    description_full: This code updates JonnyMac's nice WS2812 sample 'jm_ws2812'
      to properly execute on a RadioShack p/n 2760339 Tri-LED strip.  The timing constants
      are different, but no big deal.  The RadioShack LED strip is pretty cool, and
      I've also tried using the AdaFruit LED strips which work in a similar manner.  I
      hope this update saves a new coder some time in figuring out these LED strips.
