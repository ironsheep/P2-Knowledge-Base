    description_full: Modified Quadrature Decoder object by Luke Hays to use a third
      pin to preset encoder count to any value allowing the calculation of absolute
      encoder angle. See Luke Hays' example for reference. The same except uses third
      pin for index and allows preset by setting the value of BigValue in the asm
      section of the program.
