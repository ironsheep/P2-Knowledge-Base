    description_full: Infinite Implulse Response (IIR) Recursive filter, implemented
      in pasm, with recursion. Starts a cog which continuously polls a memory location
      looking for a data value. The design objective for this filter was to make it
      as fast as possible. It is implemented using fixed point math in a single cog
      and is capable of 180K samples/sec @ 80 MHz with a simple high or low pass filter.
      This object also contains a set of filter synthesis methods to facilitate filter
      setup, though the user can also manually input filter coefficients if desired.
      The filter is also constructed to facilitate easy chaining of filters.
