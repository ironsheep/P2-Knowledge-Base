    description_full: This is the FullDuplexParallel object v1.0. It is based on the
      FullDuplexSerial object v1.1 from the Propeller Tool's Library folder with modified
      documentation and methods for converting text strings into numeric values in
      several bases. It interfaces the propeller with the FTDI FT245 Parallel FIFO.
      The FTDI FT245 allows for high performance I/O to a PC.
