    description_full: Navigation-Oriented Symbolic Instruction Code. This lets you
      use xbees to get ascii renderings from a camera-equipped robot and issue commands
      to it, program it over the radio link, and the simple networking interface even
      lets you use robots as repeaters for when you think you're getting out of xbee
