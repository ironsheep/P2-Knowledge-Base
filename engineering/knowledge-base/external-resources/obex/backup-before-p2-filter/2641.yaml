    description_full: 'This is a quick small modification to Chip''s TV_TEXT.spin
      and TV.spin routines, that allow 40x30 tile text display in NTSC ( or PAL )
      using the ROM FONT, which as a 16x16, by OR''ing each two pixel lines together,
      and using interlaced, to get the 640x480 resolution needed for 40x30 tiles.

      It''s currently set up for HYBRID ( 6Mhz Clock, and tv on pins 24 ) but you
      can change that in "tv_text_half_height_demo.spin".'
