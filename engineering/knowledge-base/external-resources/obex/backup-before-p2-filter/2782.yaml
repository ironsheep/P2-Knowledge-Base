    description_full: The L298 chip is used for direction and PWM motor speed control.
      The objects have been tested using two motors. A dedicated cog is used to maintain
      the PWM stream. Speed and direction changes are ramped to maintain smooth operation.
      If a change in direction is called for while the motor is running the motor
      speed will ramp down to zero before the direction change is carried out.
