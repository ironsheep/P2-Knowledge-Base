    description_full: Demo of TAOS TSL230 light to frequency sensor driver with manual
      and auto scaling capabilities. This driver uses the INTER-PULSE method to estimate
      light intensity (i.e. counts ticks between falling edge-rising edge pairs in
      TSL230 output pulse train). Yields highest possible update bandwidth (>1M samples/sec
      in bright light) but also more susceptible to noise.
