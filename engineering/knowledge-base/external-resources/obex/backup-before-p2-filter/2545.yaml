    description_full: tx.spin is a set of routines that allow the transmission of
      serial data. tx.spin is derived from FullDuplexSerial.spin. The benefit it has
      over the transmission routines in FullDuplexSerial.spin is that it is optimized
      for the transmission of a serial string. FullDuplexSerial.spin uses an assembly
      language routine to send a byte, and for strings it calls that routine repeatedly
      for each character in the string. For FullDuplexSerial.spin, each character
      in a string is transmitted with a multi-microsecond gap following it. tx.spin
      utilizes an assembly routine for the transmission of the string, which can transmit
      the characters within the string without dead-time.
