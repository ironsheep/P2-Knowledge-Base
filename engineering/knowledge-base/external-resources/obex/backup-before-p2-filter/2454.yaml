    description_full: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Recursive filter, implemented
      in PASM with floatmath. Starts a cog which continuously polls a memory location
      looking for a data value. The design objective for this filter was to make a
      reasonably high performance IIR filter with the greatest possible bandwidth
      in a single cog. Typical filter bandwith (using ALL filter coefficients) is
      4.8K samples/sec @ 80 MHz. No filter synthesis methods are provided with this
      object (beyond a few demo filter kernels)--it is up to the user to roll their
      own coefficients. The filter is set up to facilitate easy chaining of filters
      if desired.
