    description_full: Moving average filter, implemented in PASM, with recursion.
      Starts a cog which continuously polls a memory location looking for a data value.
      Max filter bandwidth ~1M samples/sec @ 80 MHz, max filter kernel length is 400.
      This filter can be daisy-chained to produce triangular and Gaussian filter kernels.
