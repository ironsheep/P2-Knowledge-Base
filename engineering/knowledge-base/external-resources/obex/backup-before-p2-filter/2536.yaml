    description_full: This object permits the Propeller to communicate with a vehicle's
      on-board computer through CAN. Designed specifically for OBD-II, it communicates
      at 500Kbps, send queries to the on-board computer and stores the response data
      in a buffer for use by other methods. This object requires a CAN transceiver
      chip such as the Microchip MCP2551 to perform level shifting and line driving,
      all other aspects of the CAN protocol are handled by the Propeller. Includes
      a demo routine, which uses a serial terminal to send commands to and display
      responses from the main OBD object.
