    description_full: Motor driver using two IR2101 driver chips from International
      Rectifier. These chips drive an H bridge made with MOSFETS or IGBTs. For driving
      DC permanent magnet motor or other inductive DC load. After driver is started
      writing a "duty cycle" value of -4000 to 4000 to a long variable creates nearly
      full negative and nearly full positive voltage output. Duty cycle may be commanded
      by a Spin or an Assembly program.
