    description_full: This PASM program constantly measures the pulse width of a 60-Hz
      clipped signal from a power transformer. This transformer is used to power the
      propeller circuit. In the event of a power loss (1st lost cycle) or simply turning
      off the power, the brownout detector clears a variable to 0, signaling your
      SPIN program to save it's variables to EEPROM memory before losing power. I
      have included a small demo program to show how I use it. The revised program
      returns the line frequency of the 60-hz power as a value close to 666_666 =
      (80_000_000/120Hz)
