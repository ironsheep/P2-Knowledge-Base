    description_full: This object takes advantage of the BNO08x RVC (serial) output
      to provide Yaw, Pitch, Roll, X acceleration, Y acceleration, and Z acceleration.
      Each packet is framed with a specific, two-byte header ($AAAA) which is very
      easy to detect. Sensor values are provided in 16-bit signed format and converted
      by the object to signed longs.
