    description_full: Includes Spin-based and PASM-based open-drain and push-pull
      drivers, with methods for reading and writing any number of bytes, words, and
      longs in big-endian or little-endian format.  All drivers tested with the 24LC256
      EEPROM, DS1307 real time clock, MMA7455L 3-axis accelerometer, L3G4200D gyroscope
      module, MS5607 altimeter module, and BMP085 pressure sensor.  Includes a demo
      programs for each.
