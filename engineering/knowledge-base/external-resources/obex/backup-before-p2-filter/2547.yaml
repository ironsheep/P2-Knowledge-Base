    description_full: This is an object which encodes 16-bit stereo 44.1/48 KHz audio
      into an SPDIF signal. SPDIF is the protocol used by TOSLINK (optical) and Coax
      digital audio inputs on most home theater receivers and stereo systems. Some
      PC sound cards also have SPDIF inputs. Play high-quality audio on your Prop
