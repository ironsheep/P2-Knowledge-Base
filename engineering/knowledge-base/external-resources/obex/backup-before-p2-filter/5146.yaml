    description_full: Determine the execution time of Spin or Propeller Assembly code
      on the P8X32A by using the system counter, by toggling an I/O pin, or by counting
      assembly instruction cycles. The techniques presented are vital for discovering
      or verifying routine timing and tuning code to an application's needs.
