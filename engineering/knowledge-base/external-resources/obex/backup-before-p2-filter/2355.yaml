    description_full: Modified version of Chip's original MCP3208 code. Designed to
      speed up the ADC process by doing all of the calculations in assembly code.
      Use for single and average ADC samples. A 10 sample average of ADC samples is
      six times faster than the original code. Same calling sequence as original code.
      Used for single mode ADC only. Does not provide DAC output. Deterministic output
      in the sense that it always takes the same number of clock cycles per sample(s).
      License added 2/27/08.
