    description_full: TAOS TSL230 light to frequency sensor driver. Uses the PULSE
      INTEGRATION method to estimate light intensity (i.e. pulse outputs from TSL230
      are accumulated for a fixed period of time). Based on the original object by
      Paul Baker, with various modifications including use of a moving average filter
      in the assembly routine to smooth the output.
