    description_full: This is a small driver for controlling / making a Triac based
      light dimmer. Nothing exceptional but it works and is easy to work with - 1
      variable. It uses the zero crossing signal from an opto-isolator and then delays
      triggering the triac (also through an opto-isolator) until the proper amount
      of time has elapsed. Allows setting the brightness of a light (or other resistive
      load) from 0% to 100% in 256 steps. I have also included a small 120-Hz zero-crossing
      simulator object so you can either simulate the hardware signal during development
      or use it to dim LEDs or other Pulse Width Modulated devices not attached to
      a 60-Hz power line.
