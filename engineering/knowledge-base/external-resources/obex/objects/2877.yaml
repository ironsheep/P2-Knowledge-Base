    description_full: 'This object implements a step motor driver.

      The trajectory is sinusoidal, ramp up, a period at constant speed, ramp down.

      A STOP input is monitored that will decelerate the motor to a stop in a controlled
      fashion.

      There are two versions. One for drivers that use step and direction inputs and
      one for drivers with cw and ccw inputs.

      A demo program in spin2 is included.'
