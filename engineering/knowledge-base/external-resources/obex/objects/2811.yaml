    description_full: 'The Park or d/q-transformation is useful when controlling AC
      motors or brushless servo motors. It transforms currents or voltages from a
      three phase system with stator reference into a rectangular coordinate system
      that is referenced to the rotor. The output can be treated as if the motor was
      a DC machine. After calculations (PID control) are done the values are transformed
      back to the three phase system using the inverse Park transformation. The results
      can then be output to a three phase power stage.

      This is a small code snippet that demonstrates how the P2 CORDIC unit can be
      used for the Park transformation and its inverse. It uses 16 bit signed format
      for all current and voltage values. This should be sufficient for most applications.
      The CORDIC even could do full 32 bit resolution, only the scaling had to use
      32 bit multiplication instead of the SCAS instructions. The angle (theta) has
      to be left adjusted.'
