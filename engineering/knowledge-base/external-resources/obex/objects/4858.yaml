    description_full: This object makes a 4-channel, constant-impedance, high-performance
      ADC which uses 3 contiguous pins per channel. At 200MHz, it can generate 13-bit
      samples at 16k samples per second on all four channels. Sampling time can be
      roughly doubled to gain another effective bit. All readings are reported in
