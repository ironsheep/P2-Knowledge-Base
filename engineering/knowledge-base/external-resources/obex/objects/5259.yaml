    description_full: This object takes advantage of the BNO08x RVC (serial) output
      to provide Yaw, Pitch, Roll, X acceleration, Y acceleration, and Z acceleration
      using Smart Pin serial RX without a cog. This is possible because each packet
      is framed with a specific, two-byte header ($AAAA) which is very easy to detect.
