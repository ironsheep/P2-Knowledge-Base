    description_full: This object takes advantage of the P2 smart pins to modulate
      an IR LED using the Sony IRCS command protocol. Output can be inline (blocking)
      or run in the background if a spare cog is available. The tx() method allows
      the program to define the code, the number of bits for that code (usually 12,
      15, or 20), and the number of times to repeat the code (at typical TV remote
      will repeat a code three to five times).
