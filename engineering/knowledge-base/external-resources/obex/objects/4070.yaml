    description_full: "The MFRC522\u2019s internal transmitter is able to drive a\
      \ reader/writer antenna designed to\ncommunicate with ISO/IEC 14443 A/MIFARE\
      \ cards and transponders without additional\nactive circuitry. The receiver\
      \ module provides a robust and efficient implementation for\ndemodulating and\
      \ decoding signals from ISO/IEC 14443 A/MIFARE compatible cards and\ntransponders.\
      \ The digital module manages the complete ISO/IEC 14443 A framing and\nerror\
      \ detection (parity and CRC) functionality."
