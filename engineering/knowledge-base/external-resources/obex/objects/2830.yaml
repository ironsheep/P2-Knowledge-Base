    description_full: This object is a C-to-Spin2 translation of the Qwiic Twist library
      for  the Sparkfun Qwiic Twist encoder. This product connects via I2C which allows
      multiple devices to share one set of pins (I2C bus). All functions in the original
      library are supported in the Spin2 library (though naming conventions conform
      to JM's Spin2 style guidelines).
