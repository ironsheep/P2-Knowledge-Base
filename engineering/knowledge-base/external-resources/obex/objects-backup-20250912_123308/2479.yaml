    description_full: This object emulates a Playstation 2 Dual Shock controller.
      Run five wires between the Propeller and a Playstation or Playstation 2 console,
      and the Propeller can impersonate a controller. Use this module to experiment
      with new or non-traditional video game controllers, or to create applications
      that sit between a Playstation system and your controllers. It supports all
      the features of the Dual Shock controller, including force feedback and pressure-sensitive
      buttons.
