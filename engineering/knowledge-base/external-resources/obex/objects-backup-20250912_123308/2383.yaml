    description_full: For position control of robotics and machinery, a relable quadrature
      encoder interface is a must. This demoapplication show how to use the Lsi 7366
      as encoder interface. Aside counting edges of an encoder, the Lsi 7366 has a
      compare and trigger (latch) function. for the lsi7366 and demoboard you can
      look at www.propbotics.eu
