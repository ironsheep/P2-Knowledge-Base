    description_full: UART serial transceiver driver.  This object is capable of 1Mbuad
      communication speeds in a single cog with simultaneous transmit and receive.  Examples
      are provided for both spin and assembly control of the serial driver core.  This
      is a fixed buad rate UART module intended for use with 80 MHz clocked propeller
      chips.  If another clock frequency is chosen the baud rate with scale proportionally.
