    description_full: An ASM driver for communicating with the Wiznet W5100 Ethernet
      IC using Indirect/Parallel. This driver launches a COG that handles FAST reading
      and writing to the W5100. There are routines in both ASM and SPIN for establishing
      communication and transferring data and settings. See the file for further instructions
      on usage.
