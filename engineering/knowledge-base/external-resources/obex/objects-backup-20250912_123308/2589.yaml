    description_full: Uses a single cog to read NMEA messages from a GPS receiver
      (GGA and RMC messages currently supported), parses the messages to extract time,
      date, latitude, longitude, altitude, course, and speed and reformats into readable
      ASCII strings.  Also presents latitude, longitude, altitude, course, and speed
      as binary values.
