    description_full: 'This code updates JonnyMac''s nice WS2812 sample ''jm_ws2812''
      to properly execute on a RadioShack p/n 2760249 Tri-LED strip.

      The timing constants are different, but no big deal.  The RadioShack LED strip
      is pretty cool, and I''ve also tried using the

      AdaFruit LED strips which work in a similar manner.  I hope this update saves
      a new coder some time in figuring out these

      LED strips.  Note that the code for this part number and the newer Radio Shack
      2760339 are different in 2 respects.

      First, the RGB layout is different and second, the timing constants are different.'
