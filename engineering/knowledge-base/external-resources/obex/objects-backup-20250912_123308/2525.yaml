    description_full: This is a driver for Winbond Flash Memory (W25X16AVDAIZ 2MB)
      as well as equivalent 1MB, 4MB and 8MB memories. It also supports 1 or 2 Microchip
      23K256 SPI SRAM. It provides a simple file system with 8.3 named files and basic
      wear levelling through distributing files across the memory. Multiple files
      can be open at the same time.
