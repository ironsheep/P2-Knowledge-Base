    description_full: Driver for SPI-SRAM N256S0830HDA. 3 drivers in download for
      1 bit, 2bit and 4 bit wide memory board. Download contains schematic and PCB
      layout for a 4bit wide memory board. Driver is also a example of how to do SPI
      using counters for SPI clock, allows SPI speeds upto 10MHz.
