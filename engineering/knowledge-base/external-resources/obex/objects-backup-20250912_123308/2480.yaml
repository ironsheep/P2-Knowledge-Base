    description_full: 'Frequency Synthesis/PWM X31:

      This program grants the ability to output up to 31 frequencies at once using
      the resources of only a single cog. With a clock speed of 80MHz, output can
      stably reach as high as 320KHz. If more than one output is used (the main purpose
      of this program), the maximum frequencies depend on the amount and combination
      of frequencies. To approximate: Max-Hz = 4000 * MHz / channels.'
