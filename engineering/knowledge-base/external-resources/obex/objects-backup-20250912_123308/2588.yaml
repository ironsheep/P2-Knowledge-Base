    description_full: An ASM driver for communicating with the Wiznet W5100 Ethernet
      IC using SPI. This driver launches a COG that handles FAST reading and writing
      to the W5100. There are routines in both ASM and SPIN for establishing communication
      and transferring data and settings.
