    description_full: This object grew out of a discussion with deSilva. It is an
      extension of graphics.spin that allows for using the ROM font, Clemens font
      and the standard vector font. It also has a new XOR mode and methods for switching
      between XOR and standard mode. The demo was mostly coded by deSilva and shows
      the smooth animation that can be achieved with only a single buffer in XOR mode.
