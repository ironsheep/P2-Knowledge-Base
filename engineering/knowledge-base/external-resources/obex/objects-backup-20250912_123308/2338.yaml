    description_full: Driver for MCP3X0X ADCs. Driver features include support for
      Microchip ADCs with anywhere between 1 and 8 ADC input channels and resolutions
      of 16 bits or less. Both single-ended and differential modes are supported.
      The driver adds support for frequency reading on each of the channels and allows
      the ADC to react as a programmable Schmitt trigger. Also available is gathering
      of maximum and minimum or average values of the channels over time. The driver
      can wait for a channel to achieve a specific state, or can even be put into
      standby to save power. Channel values and states are available to multiple objects
      if the driver is supplied with variables to store the information.
