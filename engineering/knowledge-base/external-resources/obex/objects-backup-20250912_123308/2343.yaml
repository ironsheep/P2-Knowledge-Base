    description_full: Includes a Spin and Assembly driver for the TSL3301 digital
      line image sensor. Spin can do line integration times longer than 1mS, while
      the assembly driver can do integration times as short as 2uS. The spin driver
      should be capable of ~10-20 lines per second, while the Assembly driver should
      work at up to 5000 lines per second. The assembly driver also includes the option
      to trigger capture with an input pin. (minimum 500nS delay from the trigger
      to the electronic shutter opening)
