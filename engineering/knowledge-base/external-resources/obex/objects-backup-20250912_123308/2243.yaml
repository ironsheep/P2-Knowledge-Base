    description_full: The enclosed programs include a demo and two drivers. The programs
      are for use with the uOLED-96-PROP by 4D Systems. The demo program demonstrates
      the use of the display driver (code that clocks Propeller memory to the OLED
      GRAM). The display driver is written in ASM and is very fast (6ms per screen
      update). The graphics driver (code the draws objects in the Propeller memory)
      is written in SPIN and is a collection of routines to draw lines, circles, sprites
      and text into the Propeller memory.
