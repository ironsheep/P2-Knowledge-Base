operation_description: |
  USB host/device mode provides USB communication protocol support using even/odd pin pairs
  for differential signaling (DM/DP). Handles both USB host and device functionality with
  support for low-speed (1.5 Mbps) and full-speed (12 Mbps) operation. OUT signal overridden
  for USB protocol control.
