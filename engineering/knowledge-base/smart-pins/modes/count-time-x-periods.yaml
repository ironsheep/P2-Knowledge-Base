operation_description: |
  Counts clock cycles from each A-input rise/edge to each B-input rise/edge for X periods.
  Y[1:0] sets sensitivity (A-rise to B-rise/edge, A-edge to B-rise/edge). Oversampling
  period measurement - accumulates time within X complete periods for precise average
  period calculation.

x_parameter:
  usage: "Number of periods to measure"
  bit_fields:
    - range: "X[31:0]"
      purpose: "Period count to accumulate"

y_parameter:
  usage: "Edge sensitivity selection"
  bit_fields:
    - range: "Y[1:0]"
      purpose: "00=A-rise to B-rise, 01=A-rise to B-edge, 10=A-edge to B-rise, 11=A-edge to B-edge"

z_result:
  data_type: "32-bit accumulated time"
  bit_interpretation:
    - range: "Z[31:0]"
      meaning: "Total time for X periods (limited to $80000000)"
