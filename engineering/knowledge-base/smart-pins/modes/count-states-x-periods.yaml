operation_description: |
  Counts A-input trigger states from each A-input rise/edge to each B-input rise/edge
  for X periods. Complementary to %10011 - provides oversampled duty measurement rather
  than period measurement. Accumulates A-trigger states across X complete periods.

x_parameter:
  usage: "Number of periods to measure"
  bit_fields:
    - range: "X[31:0]"
      purpose: "Period count for state accumulation"

y_parameter:
  usage: "Edge sensitivity selection"
  bit_fields:
    - range: "Y[1:0]"
      purpose: "00=A-rise to B-rise, 01=A-rise to B-edge, 10=A-edge to B-rise, 11=A-edge to B-edge"

z_result:
  data_type: "32-bit accumulated states"
  bit_interpretation:
    - range: "Z[31:0]"
      meaning: "Total A-trigger states for X periods"
