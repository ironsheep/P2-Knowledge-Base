operation_description: |
  ADC sample/filter/capture with external clocking facilitates sampling, SINC filtering, and
  raw capturing of external delta-sigma ADC bitstream data. A-input sampled on each B-input
  rise, allowing external ADC integration. Same SINC2/SINC3 filtering modes as internal clock
  version but triggered by external clock source.
