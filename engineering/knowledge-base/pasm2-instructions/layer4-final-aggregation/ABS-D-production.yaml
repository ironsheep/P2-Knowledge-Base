# === PRODUCTION INSTRUCTION DOCUMENTATION ===

instruction:
  mnemonic: "ABS"
  syntax: "ABS D {WC/WZ/WCZ}"
  description: "Get absolute value of D into D"
  category: "arithmetic_unary"
  
operation:
  mathematical_definition: "D = |D|"
  algorithm: |
    if D < 0 then
      D = -D    // Two's complement negation
    else  
      D = D     // No change for positive values
  
  flag_effects:
    C: "Set to original sign bit D[31] before operation"
    Z: "Set if result equals zero"
    
timing:
  execution_cycles: 2
  pipeline_stage: "Execute"
  dependencies: "None"
  
operands:
  D:
    type: "register"
    description: "Source and destination register (cog/LUT register 0-511)"
    constraints: "Any general-purpose register"
    
encoding:
  opcode_pattern: "0001011D DDDDDDDD 000001CC IIIWWWWW"

examples:
  basic_usage:
    code: |
      mov    temp, sensor_reading    ' Load signed sensor value  
      abs    temp              WZ    ' Get magnitude, Z if exactly zero
      if_z   jmp   #no_signal        ' Handle zero case
      
  distance_calculation:
    code: |
      sub    dx, x2, x1             ' Calculate delta X
      sub    dy, y2, y1             ' Calculate delta Y  
      abs    dx                     ' Get X magnitude
      abs    dy                     ' Get Y magnitude
      add    distance, dx           ' Manhattan distance
      add    distance, dy
      
edge_cases:
  overflow_condition:
    input: "$80000000 (most negative 32-bit integer)"
    output: "$80000000 (unchanged)"  
    note: "True absolute value cannot be represented in 32-bit signed format"
    
  zero_input:
    input: "$00000000"
    output: "$00000000, C=0, Z=1"
    
  positive_input:
    input: "$7FFFFFFF (most positive)"
    output: "$7FFFFFFF, C=0, Z=0"

compiler_integration:
  spin2_builtin: "ABS(expression)"
  direct_mapping: "Maps directly to ABS instruction when operand is register"
  optimization_level: "Always optimal - no improvement possible"

performance_notes:
  - "Always executes in exactly 2 clock cycles"
  - "No pipeline stalls or resource conflicts"
  - "Can be paired with conditional operations using C flag"
  - "Suitable for vectorization and loop optimization"
