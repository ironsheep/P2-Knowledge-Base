  detailed_behavior:
    algorithm: |
      if D[31] == 1 then  // negative number
        D = ~D + 1        // two's complement negation
      else
        D = D             // positive number unchanged
    
    edge_cases:
      - case: "D = $80000000 (most negative 32-bit integer)"
        result: "D remains $80000000 (overflow condition)"
        note: "Mathematical absolute value cannot be represented in 32-bit signed"
      - case: "D = $00000000"
        result: "D = $00000000, C = 0"
        note: "Absolute value of zero is zero"
      - case: "D = $7FFFFFFF (most positive)"
        result: "D = $7FFFFFFF, C = 0"
        note: "Already positive, no change"
        
  flag_behavior:
    c_flag:
      purpose: "Indicates original sign of input"
      calculation: "C = original D[31]"
      usage: "Allows detection of whether negation occurred"
    z_flag:
      purpose: "Indicates zero result"
      calculation: "Z = (result == 0)"
      usage: "Standard zero detection"

usage_patterns:
  common_applications:

    - "Distance calculations in coordinate systems"
    - "Error magnitude computation"
    - "Preparing values for unsigned operations"
    
  code_examples:
    basic_usage: |
      mov    x, sensor_reading    ' Load signed sensor value
      abs    x             WZ    ' Get absolute value, set Z if zero
      if_z   jmp   #no_signal     ' Branch if sensor reads exactly zero
      
    magnitude_vector: |
      abs    delta_x       WC    ' Get X magnitude, C = was_negative
      abs    delta_y             ' Get Y magnitude  
      add    total, delta_x      ' Manhattan distance calculation
      add    total, delta_y
