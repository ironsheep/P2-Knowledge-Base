description: 'SCA multiplies the lower 16-bits of each of Dest and Src together, right shifts the 32-bit
  product by 16 (to scale Result: The upper 16 bits of the unsigned product from the 16-bit Dest and Src
  multiplication is substituted as the next instruction''s Src value and optionally the Z flag is updated
  to the zero status.'
category: Math Instruction - Create unsigned 16-bit scale value for next instruction's S value.
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the 16-bit value to multiply with Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 16-bit augmented literal whose value is multiplied with Dest.
- WZ is an optional effect to update the Z flag.
