description: "SCA multiplies the lower 16-bits of each of Dest and Src together, right shifts the 32-bit\
  \ product by 16 (to scale Result: The upper 16 bits of the unsigned product from the 16-bit Dest and\

parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the 16-bit value to multiply with Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 16-bit augmented literal whose value is multiplied with Dest.
- "WZ is an optional effect to update the Z \uFB02ag."
