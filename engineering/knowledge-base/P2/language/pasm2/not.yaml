result: "!Src (or !Dest) is stored in Dest and \uFB02ags are optionally updated with the NOTed high bit\

parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to bitwise NOT (syntax 2) or to be replaced by the bitwise
  NOT of Src (syntax 1).
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value will be bitwise
  NOTed and stored into Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
