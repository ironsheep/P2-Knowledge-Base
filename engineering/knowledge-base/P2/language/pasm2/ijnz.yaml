group: Flow Control Instruction - Increment value and jump if zero or not zero.
description: 'IJZ or IJNZ increments the value in Dest, writes the result, and jumps
  to the address described by Src if the Result: Dest is incremented, and if the result
  is zero (or not zero in syntax 2), PC is set to a new relative (#Src) or absolute
  (Src) address.'

parameters:
- Dest is a register whose value is incremented and tested for zero or not zero.
- 'Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 20-bit augmented literal whose value is the
  absolute or relative address to set PC to. Use # for relative addressing; omit #
  for absolute addressing.'
