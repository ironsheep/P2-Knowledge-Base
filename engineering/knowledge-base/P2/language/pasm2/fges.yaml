description: 'FGES sets signed Dest to signed Src if Dest is less than Src. This is
  also known as a limit minimum function; Result: Signed Dest is set to signed Src
  if Dest was less than Src. Optionally the C and Z flag indicates if the replacement
  happened and the zero status of the result.'
category: Math Instruction - Force signed value to be greater than or equal to another.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: 1, else D same and C = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the signed value to limit to a minimum of signed Src,
  and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose signed value
  is the lower limit to force upon Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
