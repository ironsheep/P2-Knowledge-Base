group: Event Monitor Instruction - Retrieve and clear streamer-finished event flag.
description: "Streamer-finished event flag is optionally copied into C and/or Z, then it is cleared.\n\
  \nPOLLXFI copies the state of the streamer-\uFB01nished event \uFB02ag into C and/or Z and then clears\
  \ the \uFB02ag (unless it's\n\nbeing set again by the event sensor).\n\nIf the WC, WZ, or WCZ effect\
  \ is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag and/or Z \uFB02ag is updated to the state of the streamer-\uFB01\
  nished\n\nevent \uFB02ag prior to clearing it.\n\nThe streamer-\uFB01nished event \uFB02ag is set whenever\
  \ the streamer runs out of commands to process. The\n\nstreamer-\uFB01nished event \uFB02ag is cleared\
  \ upon execution of XINIT, XZERO, XCONT, POLLXFI, WAITXFI, JXFI, or\n\nJNXFI instructions."
