description: "SETNIB stores Src[3:0] into the nibble identified by Num within Dest, or the nibble and\
  \ register described by a prior Result: Src[3:0] is written to nibble Num (0\u20137) of Dest, or to\
  \ another register nibble described by prior ALTSN instruction.\n\nSETNIB stores Src[3:0] into the nibble\
  \ identi\uFB01ed by Num within Dest, or the nibble and register described by a prior\n\nALTSN instruction.\
  \ No other bits are modi\uFB01ed.\n\nNum (0\u20137) identi\uFB01es a value's individual nibbles, by\
  \ position, in least-signi\uFB01cant nibble order.\n\nSyntax 2 is intended for use after an ALTSN instruction;\
  \ i.e. in a loop to iteratively affect a series of nibble values\n\nwithin contiguous long registers."
parameters:
- Dest is the register in which to modify a nibble.
- Src is a register or 4-bit literal whose bits [3:0] will be stored in the designated location.
- "Num is a 3-bit literal identifying the nibble ID (0\u20137) of Dest to modify."
