instruction: DRVNC
syntax: DRVNC   {#}D           {WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 1101011 CZL DDDDDDDDD 001011011
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: I/O Pin Instruction - Set pin(s) direction to output and output level to low/high
  according to C or !C.
description: 'DRVC or DRVNC sets the I/O pin(s) designated by Dest to the output direction
  and to a low/high output level Result: The I/O pins described by Dest are set to
  the output direction and to an output level of low/high according to C or !C; the
  rest are left as-is. Z = OUT bit.'
flags_affected:
  Z:
    formula: OUT bit
parameters:
- Dest is the register, 9-bit literal, or 11-bit augmented literal whose value identifies
  the I/O pin(s) to set to output direction and output levels of low or high.
- WCZ is an optional effect to update flags.
