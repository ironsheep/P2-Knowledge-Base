  \ clears the event flag Result: Wait for attention event, then clear the flag; optionally aborting on\
  \ timeout and setting C and/or Z on abort. Z = timeout.\n\nWAITATN waits for an attention event to occur\
  \ (unless the event \uFB02ag is already set), then clears the event \uFB02ag\n\n(unless it's being set\
  \ again by the event sensor) and resumes execution at the next instruction. Optionally,\n\nWAITATN can\
  \ time-out if the attention event doesn't occur soon enough; setting C and/or Z \uFB02ags and then\n\
  \nresuming execution at the next instruction.\n\nTo set the optional timeout, insert a SETQ (with a\
  \ future System Counter target value) right before WAITATN.\n\nThe WC, WZ, or WCZ effect is recommended\
  \ only if the optional timeout is speci\uFB01ed, in which case the C \uFB02ag and/or\n\nZ \uFB02ag is\
  \ set (1) if a timeout occurred before the event, or is cleared (0) if the event occurred before the\
  \ timeout.\n\nDuring a wait, the pipeline is stalled; no instructions execute and no interrupts are\
  \ processed in the cog until the\n\nwait condition ends.\n\nThe attention event \uFB02ag is set whenever\
  \ another cog issues an attention request for this cog. The attention event\n\n\uFB02ag is cleared upon\
  \ cog start, or execution of POLLATN, WAITATN, JATN, or JNATN instructions."
