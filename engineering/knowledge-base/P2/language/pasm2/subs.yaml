timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'SUBS subtracts the signed Src from the signed Dest and stores the result
  into the Dest register. If Src is a 9-bit Result: Difference of signed Dest and
  signed Src is stored in Dest and optionally the C and Z flags are updated to the
  sign and zero status.'
category: Math Instruction - Subtract one signed value from another.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: correct sign of (D - S)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to subtract Src from, and is where the result
  is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is subtracted
  from Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
