description: "SUBS subtracts the signed Src from the signed Dest and stores the result into the Dest register.\

  \ the C and Z flags are updated to the sign and zero status.\n\nSUBS subtracts the signed Src from the\
  \ signed Dest and stores the result into the Dest register. If Src is a 9-bit\n\nliteral, its value\
  \ is interpreted as positive (0-511; it is not sign-extended) \u2014 use ##Value (or insert a prior\
  \ AUGS\n\ninstruction) for a 32-bit signed value; negative or positive.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is\
  \ speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is set (1) if the subtraction results in a signed under\uFB02ow (signed\n\
  \nborrow), or is cleared (0) if no under\uFB02ow.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z\
  \ \uFB02ag is set (1) if the result of Dest - Src is zero, or is cleared (0) if it is\n\nnon-zero.\n\
  \nTo subtract signed, multi-long values, use SUB (not SUBS) followed possibly by SUBX, and \uFB01nally\
  \ SUBSX as\n\ndescribed in Subtracting Two Multi-Long Values."
flags_affected:
  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to subtract Src from, and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is subtracted from Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
