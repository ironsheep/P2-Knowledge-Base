instruction: DECMOD
syntax: DECMOD  D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0111001 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'DECMOD compares Dest with 0â€” if not equal, it decrements Dest; otherwise it sets Dest equal
  to Src. If Dest Result: If Dest was not equal to 0, it is decremented by 1; otherwise Dest is reset
  to Src. Optionally, C and Z are updated to indicate reset and zero result status.'
category: Math Instruction - Decrement with modulus.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: 1, else D = D - 1 and C = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to decrement down to 0 with modulus, and is where the result
  is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is the modulus limit to apply
  to Dest's decrement operation.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
