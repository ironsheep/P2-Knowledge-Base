flags_affected:
  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to decrement down to 0 with modulus, and is where the result
  is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is the modulus limit to apply
  to Dest's decrement operation.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
