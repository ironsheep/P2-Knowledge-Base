description: "SETD copies Src[8:0] to the D field of the template, Dest, to be used with an ALTI instruction.\
  \ Bits outside the D Result: The D field [17:9] of template Dest is set to Src[8:0].\n\nSETD copies\
  \ Src[8:0] to the D \uFB01eld of the template, Dest, to be used with an ALTI instruction. Bits outside\
  \ the D\n\n\uFB01eld remain unaffected. The D \uFB01eld (or Dest \uFB01eld) holds the address of a register\
  \ (or sometimes a literal value) for\n\nthe instruction to use as it's destination value, and usually\
  \ as its result destination, during its execution.\n\nThe ALTI template is a 32-bit value with the following\
  \ format:\n\nBits             31:28 (4 bits)          27:19 (9 bits)              18            17:9\
  \ (9 bits)          8:0 (9 bits)\n\nField Description       Condition Field         Result Field   \
  \    Indirect \"I\" Field     Dest \"D\" Field       Source \"S\" Field\n\nSETD can also be used in\
  \ self-modifying Reg RAM code. Unlike with ALTx instructions, when used this way, \uFB01eld\n\nvalue\
  \ modi\uFB01cation occurs in the program code itself (not the instruction pipeline); code is altered,\
  \ values persist.\n\nDue to the instruction pipeline nature, after modifying a code register, it is\
  \ necessary to elapse at least two\n\ninstructions before executing the modi\uFB01ed register.\n\nSETD\
  \         inst, op                        'set \"inst\" register[17:9] to op[8:0]\n\nNOP           \

  \                              'second spacer instruction, could be anything\n\ninst      MOV      \
