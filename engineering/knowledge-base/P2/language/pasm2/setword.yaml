description: "SETWORD stores Src[15:0] into the word identified by Num within Dest, or the word and register\
  \ described by a Result: Src[15:0] is written to word Num (0\u20131) of Dest, or to another register\
  \ word described by prior ALTSW instruction.\n\nSETWORD stores Src[15:0] into the word identi\uFB01\
  ed by Num within Dest, or the word and register described by a\n\nprior ALTSW instruction. No other\
  \ bits are modi\uFB01ed.\n\nNum (0\u20131) identi\uFB01es a value's individual words, by position, in\
  \ least-signi\uFB01cant word order.\n\nSyntax 2 is intended for use after an ALTSW instruction; i.e.\
  \ in a loop to iteratively affect a series of word values\n\nwithin contiguous long registers."

parameters:
- Dest is the register in which to modify a word.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 16-bit augmented literal whose bits [15:0] will be stored in the
  designated location.
- "Num is a 1-bit literal identifying the word ID (0\u20131) of Dest to modify."
