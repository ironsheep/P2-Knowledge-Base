description: "NEG negates Src (syntax 1) or Dest (syntax 2) and stores the result in the Dest register.\
  \ The negation flips the Result: The Src or Dest value is negated and stored into Dest and optionally\
  \ the C and Z flags are updated to the resulting sign and zero status.\n\nNEG negates Src (syntax 1)\
  \ or Dest (syntax 2) and stores the result in the Dest register. The negation \uFB02ips the\n\nvalue's\
  \ sign; ex: 78 becomes -78, or -306 becomes 306.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C\
  \ \uFB02ag is set (1) if the result is negative, or is cleared (0) if positive.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ\
  \ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if the result is zero, or is cleared (0) if it\
  \ is non-zero."
flags_affected:
  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register to receive the -Src value (syntax 1), or contains the value to negate (syntax 2).
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose negated value is stored
  into Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
