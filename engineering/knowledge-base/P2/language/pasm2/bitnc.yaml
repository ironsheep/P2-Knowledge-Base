description: 'BITC or BITNC alters the Dest bit(s) designated by Src to equal the state, or inverse state,
  of the C flag. All other Result: Dest bit(s) described by Src are set to C or !C; the rest are left
  as-is. Z = original D[S[4:0]].'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Set bit(s) low/high according to C or !C.
flags_affected:
  Z:
    formula: original D[S[4:0]]
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose value will have one or more bits set to C or !C.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 10-bit augmented literal whose value identifies the bit(s) to modify.
- WCZ is an optional effect to update flags.
