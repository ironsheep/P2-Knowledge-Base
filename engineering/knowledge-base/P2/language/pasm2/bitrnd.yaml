description: 'BITRND alters the Dest bit(s) designated by Src to each be an independent random low and
  high value, based on Result: Dest bit(s) described by Src are each set randomly low or high; the rest
  are left as-is. Z = original D[S[4:0]].'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Set bit(s) random low/high.
flags_affected:
  Z:
    formula: original D[S[4:0]]
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose value will have one or more bits set randomly low or high.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 10-bit augmented literal whose value identifies the bit(s) to modify.
- WCZ is an optional effect to update flags.
