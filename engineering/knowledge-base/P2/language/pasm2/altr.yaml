description: 'ALTR modifies the next instruction''s Result address to be (Src + Dest)
  & $1FF (for syntax 1), or to Dest[8:0] (for Result: The next instruction''s pipelined
  Result address (Dest address by default) is altered to be (Src + Dest) & $1FF, or
  just Dest[8:0] in syntax 2.'
category: Indirection Instruction - Alter Result register address of next instruction.
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose 9-bit value is the offset, or the full value, for the
  next instruction to operate on.
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 18-bit augmented literal whose value
  contains a base (Src[8:0]; added to offset (Dest) for the next instruction) and
  also an optional auto-indexer value (Src[17:9]; added to Dest at the end of execution).
