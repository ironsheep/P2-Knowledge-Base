description: 'CMPX compares the unsigned values of Dest and Src plus C (by subtracting Src + C from Dest)
  and optionally Result: Greater/lesser and equality status is optionally written to the C and Z flags.'
category: Math Instruction - Compare two unsigned values plus carry flag.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: borrow of (D - (S + C))
  Z:
    formula: Z AND (D == S + C)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to compare with that of Src plus C.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value plus C is compared to Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
