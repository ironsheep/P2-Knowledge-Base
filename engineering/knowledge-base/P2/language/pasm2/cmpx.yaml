  \nsetting the C and Z \uFB02ags accordingly. The CMPX instruction is used to perform unsigned multi-long\
  \ comparisons,\n\nsuch as 64-bit comparisons.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02\
  ag is set (1) if Dest is less than Src plus C, or is cleared (0) otherwise.\n\nUse WC or WCZ on preceding\
  \ CMP and CMPX instructions for proper \uFB01nal C \uFB02ag.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01\
  ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if Z was previously set and Dest equals Src + C, or it is\n\ncleared (0)\
  \ otherwise. Use WZ or WCZ on preceding CMP and CMPX instructions for proper \uFB01nal Z \uFB02ag.\n\
  \nTo compare multi-long values, use CMP followed by one or more CMPX instructions as described in Comparing\n\
  \nTwo Multi-Long Values."
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: borrow of (D - (S + C))
  Z:
    formula: Z AND (D == S + C)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to compare with that of Src plus C.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value plus C is compared to Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
