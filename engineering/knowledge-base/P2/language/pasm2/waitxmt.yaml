  \ then clears the event Result: Wait for streamer-empty event, then clear the flag; optionally aborting\
  \ on timeout and setting C and/or Z on abort. Z = timeout.\n\nWAITXMT waits for a streamer-empty event\
  \ to occur (unless the event \uFB02ag is already set), then clears the event\n\n\uFB02ag (unless it's\
  \ being set again by the event sensor) and resumes execution at the next instruction. Optionally,\n\n\
  WAITXMT can time-out if the streamer-empty event doesn't occur soon enough; setting C and/or Z \uFB02\
  ags and then\n\nresuming execution at the next instruction.\n\nTo set the optional timeout, insert a\
  \ SETQ (with a future System Counter target value) right before WAITXMT.\n\nThe WC, WZ, or WCZ effect\
  \ is recommended only if the optional timeout is speci\uFB01ed, in which case the C \uFB02ag and/or\n\
  \nZ \uFB02ag is set (1) if a timeout occurred before the event, or is cleared (0) if the event occurred\
  \ before the timeout.\n\nDuring a wait, the pipeline is stalled; no instructions execute and no interrupts\
  \ are processed in the cog until the\n\nwait condition ends.\n\nThe streamer-empty event \uFB02ag is\
  \ set whenever the streamer is ready for a new command. The streamer-empty\n\nevent \uFB02ag is cleared\
  \ upon execution of XINIT, XZERO, XCONT, POLLXMT, WAITXMT, JXMT, or JNXMT instructions."
