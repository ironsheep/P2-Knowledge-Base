description: 'SHR shifts Dest''s binary value right by Src places (0â€“31 bits) and
  sets the new MSBs to 0. This is useful for Result: The bits of Dest are shifted
  right by Src bits, inserting zeros (0) as new leftmost bits.'
category: Bit Operation / Math Instruction - Shift bits right; a.k.a. divide unsigned
  32-bit integer by power-of-two.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[0]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to right shift by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bits to shift
  right.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
