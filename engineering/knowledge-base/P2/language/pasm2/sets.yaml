  \ Bits outside the S Result: The S field [8:0] of template Dest is set to Src[8:0].\n\nSETS copies Src[8:0]\
  \ to the S \uFB01eld of the template, Dest, to be used with an ALTI instruction. Bits outside the S\n\
  \n\uFB01eld remain unaffected. The S \uFB01eld (or Src \uFB01eld) holds the address of a register or\
  \ literal value for an instruction\n\nto use as it's source value during its execution.\n\nThe ALTI\
  \ template is a 32-bit value with the following format:\n\nBits             31:28 (4 bits)         \
  \ 27:19 (9 bits)             18              17:9 (9 bits)        8:0 (9 bits)\n\nField Description\

  \ when used this way, \uFB01eld\n\nvalue modi\uFB01cation occurs in the program code itself (not the\
  \ instruction pipeline); code is altered, values persist.\n\nDue to the instruction pipeline nature,\
  \ after modifying a code register, it is necessary to elapse at least two\n\ninstructions before executing\
