group: Branch A - Call
description: 'CALL records the current state of the C and Z flags and the address of the next instruction
  (PC + 1 if Cog/LUT Result: Push current C and Z flags and address of the next instruction onto the hardware
  stack, set PC to new relative or absolute address, and optionally update C and/or Z to new state. R
  = 1 then PC += A, else PC = A.'
category: Flow Control Instruction - Call a subroutine; store return context on the stack.
compiler_category: Control Flow
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: A
parameters:
- Addr is a symbolic reference to the target subroutine; the location to set PC to. Relative addressing
  is the default; use '\' to force absolute addressing.
- Dest is a register containing the 20-bit absolute address to set PC to and optional new C and Z states.
