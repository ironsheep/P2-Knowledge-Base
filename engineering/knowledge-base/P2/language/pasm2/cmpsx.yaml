  \nCMPSX compares the signed values of Dest and Src plus C (by subtracting Src + C from Dest) and optionally\n\
  \nsetting the C and Z \uFB02ags accordingly. The CMPSX instruction is used to perform signed multi-long\
  \ comparisons,\n\nsuch as 64-bit comparisons.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02\
  ag is set (1) if Dest is less than Src + C (as multi-long values). Use WC\n\nor WCZ on preceding CMP\
  \ and CMPX instructions for proper \uFB01nal C \uFB02ag.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed,\
  \ the Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if Z was previously set and the result of Dest - (Src + C) is\n\nzero, or\
  \ it is cleared (0) if non-zero. Use WZ or WCZ on preceding SUB and SUBX instructions for proper \uFB01\
  nal Z \uFB02ag.\n\nTo compare signed, multi-long values, use CMP (not CMPS) followed possibly by CMPX,\
  \ and \uFB01nally CMPSX as\n\ndescribed in Comparing Two Multi-Long Values."
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: correct sign of (D - (S + C))
  Z:
    formula: Z AND (D == S + C)
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to compare with that of Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is compared to Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
