instruction: CMPSX
syntax: CMPSX   D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0010011 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'CMPSX compares the signed values of Dest and Src plus C (by subtracting
  Src + C from Dest) and optionally Result: Greater/lesser and equality status is
  optionally written to the C and Z flags.'
category: Math Instruction - Compare two signed values plus carry flag.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: correct sign of (D - (S + C))
  Z:
    formula: Z AND (D == S + C)
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to compare with that of Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is compared
  to Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
