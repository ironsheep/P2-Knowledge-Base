description: "SETBYTE stores Src[7:0] into the byte identified by Num within Dest, or the byte and register\
  \ described by a prior Result: Src[7:0] is written to byte Num (0\u20133) of Dest, or to another register\
  \ byte described by prior ALTSB instruction.\n\nSETBYTE stores Src[7:0] into the byte identi\uFB01ed\
  \ by Num within Dest, or the byte and register described by a prior\n\nALTSB instruction. No other bits\
  \ are modi\uFB01ed.\n\nNum (0\u20133) identi\uFB01es a value's individual bytes, by position, in least-signi\uFB01\
  cant byte order.\n\nSyntax 2 is intended for use after an ALTSB instruction; i.e. in a loop to iteratively\
  \ affect a series of byte values\n\nwithin contiguous long registers."

parameters:
- Dest is the register in which to modify a byte.
- Src is a register or 8-bit literal whose bits [7:0] will be stored in the designated location.
- "Num is a 2-bit literal identifying the nibble ID (0\u20133) of Dest to modify."
