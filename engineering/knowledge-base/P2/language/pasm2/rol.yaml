  \ All MSBs rotated out are moved into the new LSBs.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the\
  \ C \uFB02ag is updated to the value of the last bit rotated out (effectively C =\n\nresult bit \"0\"\
  ) if Src is 1\u201331, or to Dest[31] if Src is 0.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the\
  \ Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if the Dest result equals zero, or is cleared (0) if it is\n\nnon-zero. Since\
  \ no bits are lost by this operation, the result will only be zero if Dest started at zero."
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[31]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to rotate left by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bit positions to rotate.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
