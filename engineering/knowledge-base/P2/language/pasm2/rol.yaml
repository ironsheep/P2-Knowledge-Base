description: 'ROL rotates Dest''s binary value left by Src places (0â€“31 bits). All MSBs rotated out are
  moved into the new LSBs. Result: The bits of Dest are rotated left by Src bits; any departing MSBs are
  moved into LSBs.'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Rotate bits left.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[31]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to rotate left by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bit positions to rotate.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
