description: 'FLTC or FLTNC sets the I/O pin(s) designated by Dest to the input direction
  and to a low/high output level Result: The I/O pins described by Dest are set to
  the input direction and to an output level of low/high according to C or !C; the
  rest are left as-is. Z = OUT bit.'
category: I/O Pin Instruction - Set pin(s) direction to input and an output level
  of low/high according to C.

    formula: OUT bit
parameters:
- Dest is the register, 9-bit literal, or 11-bit augmented literal whose value identifies
  the I/O pin(s) to set to input direction and output levels of low or high.
- WCZ is an optional effect to update flags.
