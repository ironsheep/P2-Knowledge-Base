flags_affected:
  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register to receive the Src or -Src value (syntax 1), or contains the value to negate (syntax
  2) according to Z.
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value (if Z=0) or negated
  value (if Z=1) is stored into Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
