description: "WAITINT waits for an interrupt-occurred event to occur (unless the event flag is already\
  \ set), then clears the event Result: Wait for interrupt-occurred event, then clear the flag; optionally\
  \ aborting on timeout and setting C and/or Z on abort. Z = timeout.\n\nWAITINT waits for an interrupt-occurred\
  \ event to occur (unless the event \uFB02ag is already set), then clears the event\n\n\uFB02ag (unless\
  \ it's being set again by the event sensor) and resumes execution at the next instruction. Optionally,\n\
  \nWAITINT can time-out if the interrupt-occurred event doesn't occur soon enough; setting C and/or Z\
  \ \uFB02ags and\n\nthen resuming execution at the next instruction.\n\nTo set the optional timeout,\
  \ insert a SETQ (with a future System Counter target value) right before WAITINT.\n\nThe WC, WZ, or\
  \ WCZ effect is recommended only if the optional timeout is speci\uFB01ed, in which case the C \uFB02\
  ag and/or\n\nZ \uFB02ag is set (1) if a timeout occurred before the event, or is cleared (0) if the\
  \ event occurred before the timeout.\n\nDuring a wait, the pipeline is stalled; no instructions execute\
  \ and no interrupts are processed in the cog until the\n\nwait condition ends.\n\nThe interrupt-occurred\
  \ event \uFB02ag is set whenever interrupt 1, 2, or 3 occurs\u2014 debug interrupts are ignored. The\n\
  \ninterrupt-occurred event \uFB02ag is cleared upon cog start, or execution of POLLINT, WAITINT, JINT,\
  \ or JNINT\n\ninstructions."
