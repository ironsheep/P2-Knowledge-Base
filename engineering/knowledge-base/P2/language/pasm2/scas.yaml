description: 'SCAS multiplies the lower, signed 16-bits of each of Dest and Src together, right shifts
  the 32-bit product by 14 (to Result: The upper 18 bits of the signed product from the 16-bit Dest and
  Src multiplication is substituted as the next instruction''s Src value and optionally the Z flag is
  updated to the zero status.'
category: Math Instruction - Create signed 18-bit scale value for next instruction's S value.
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the signed 16-bit value to multiply with Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or signed 16-bit augmented literal whose value is multiplied with
  Dest.
