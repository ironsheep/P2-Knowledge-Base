encoding: EEEE 1101011 CZL DDDDDDDDD 001001101
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: I/O Pin Instruction - Set pin(s) output level to low/high according to Z or
  !Z.
description: 'OUTZ or OUTNZ alters the output level register''s bit(s) designated
  by Dest to equal the state, or inverse state, of Result: The I/O pin output level
  bit(s), described by Dest, are set to low/high according to Z or !Z; the rest are
  left as-is. Z = OUT bit.'
flags_affected:
  Z:
    formula: OUT bit
parameters:
- Dest is the register, 9-bit literal, or 11-bit augmented literal whose value identifies
  the I/O pin(s) for which output levels are to be set low or high.
- WCZ is an optional effect to update flags.
