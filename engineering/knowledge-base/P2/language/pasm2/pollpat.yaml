description: "POLLPAT copies the state of the pin-pattern-detected event flag into C and/or Z and then\
  \ clears the flag (unless Result: Pin-pattern-detected event flag is optionally copied into C and/or\
  \ Z, then it is cleared.\n\nPOLLPAT copies the state of the pin-pattern-detected event \uFB02ag into\
  \ C and/or Z and then clears the \uFB02ag (unless\n\nit's being set again by the event sensor).\n\n\
  If the WC, WZ, or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag and/or Z \uFB02ag is updated to the state\
  \ of the pin-pattern-detected\n\nevent \uFB02ag prior to clearing it.\n\nThe pin-pattern-detected event\
  \ \uFB02ag is set whenever the masked input pins match or don't match the pattern\n\ndescribed by a\
  \ previous SETPAT instruction. The pin-pattern-detected event \uFB02ag is cleared upon execution of\n\
  \nSETPAT, POLLPAT, WAITPAT, JPAT, or JNPAT instructions."
