description: 'TESTB or TESTBN reads the state (0/1) of a bit in Dest designated by
  Src, possibly inverts that result, and either Result: The state of Dest''s bit Src
  is read, possibly inverted, and either stored as-is, or bitwise ANDed, ORed, or
  XORed into C or Z. Z = C/Z XOR !D[S[4:0]].'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Test bit of D or !D and either store, AND, OR,
  or XOR the result into flags.

    formula: C/Z XOR !D[S[4:0]]
    when: IN[D[4:0]]
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose value will have a single bit tested.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value identifies the bit (0â€“31) of Dest
  to test.
