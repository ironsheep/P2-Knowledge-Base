  type: fixed
group: Flow Control Instruction - Call a subroutine; store return context in the Hub
  long at PTRA++ or PTRB++.
description: Write current C and Z flags and address of the next instruction into
  the 4-byte Hub RAM location at PTRA or PTRB, increment pointer, set PC to new relative
  or absolute address, and optionally update C and/or Z to new state. R = 1 then PC
  += A, else PC = A.

parameters:
- Addr is a symbolic reference to the target subroutine; the location to set PC to.
  Relative addressing is the default; use '\' to force absolute addressing.
- Dest is a register containing the 20-bit absolute address to set PC to and optional
  new C and Z states.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update the flags from Dest's upper bit states.
