description: 'RCZR shifts Dest''s binary value right by two places and sets Dest[31] to C and Dest[30]
  to Z. Result: The bits of Dest are shifted right by two places and C and Z are inserted as new MSBs.'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Rotate carry and zero flags right into value (2-bit rotate right).
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: D[1], Z = D[0]
    when: D
  Z:
    formula: D[0]
    when: D[1]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to rotate the carry and zero flags right into.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
