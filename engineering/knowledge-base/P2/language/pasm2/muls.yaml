description: 'MULS multiplies the signed lower 16-bits of each of Dest and Src together and stores the
  32-bit signed product Result: The 32-bit signed product of the signed 16-bit Dest and Src multiplication
  is stored into Dest and optionally the Z flag is updated to the Dest or Src zero status. D = signed
  (D[15:0] * S[15:0]).'
category: Math Instruction - Multiply signed 16-bit x 16-bit values.
flags_affected:
  Z:
    formula: (S == 0) | (D == 0)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the signed 16-bit value to multiply with Src, and is where the result
  is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or signed 16-bit augmented literal whose value is multiplied into
  Dest.
- WZ is an optional effect to update the Z flag.
