encoding: EEEE 0010101 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'CMPM compares the unsigned values of Dest and Src (by subtracting Src from Dest) and optionally
  setting the C Result: Greater/lesser and equality status is optionally written to the C and Z flags.'
category: Math Instruction - Compare two unsigned values, get MSB of difference.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: MSB of (D - S)
  Z:
    formula: (D == S)
    when: Result[31]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to compare with that of Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is compared to Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
