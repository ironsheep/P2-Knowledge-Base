  \ the C\n\nand Z \uFB02ags accordingly.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag\

flags_affected:
  Z: Result[31] D=S 2
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to compare with that of Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is compared to Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
