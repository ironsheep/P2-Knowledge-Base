description: 'COGBRK triggers an asynchronous breakpoint in a designated cog. The COGBRK instruction must
  be executed Result: If in the Debug ISR, trigger an asynchronous breakpoint in cog identified by Dest.


  COGBRK triggers an asynchronous breakpoint in a designated cog. The COGBRK instruction must be executed


  from within a Debug ISR (interrupt service routine) and the designated cog must already have its asynchronous


  breakpoint interrupt enabled. Dest[2:0] indicates the ID of the desired cog.'
parameters:
- Dest is the register or 9-bit literal whose value (lower 3-bits) indicates which cog to trigger.
