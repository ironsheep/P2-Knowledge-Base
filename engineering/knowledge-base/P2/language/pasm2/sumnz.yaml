group: Math and Logic
description: 'SUMZ or SUMNZ adjusts the signed Dest value by Src or -Src (depending
  on Z or !Z) and stores the result into the Result: The sum of signed Dest and either
  Src or -Src (according to Z) is stored in Dest and optionally the C and Z flags
  are updated to the sign and zero status.'
category: Math Instruction - Adjust signed value by other Z-negated or !Z-negated
  value.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: correct sign of (D +/- S)
  Z:
    formula: 0 then D = D - S, else D = D + S
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the signed value to adjust by Src or -Src, and is
  where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value (if Z=0
  or !Z=0) or negated value (if Z=1 or !Z=1) is added into Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
