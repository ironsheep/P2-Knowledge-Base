  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'SUMC or SUMNC adjusts the signed Dest value by Src or -Src (depending
  on C or !C) and stores the result into the Result: The sum of signed Dest and either
  Src or -Src (according to C) is stored in Dest and optionally the C and Z flags
  are updated to the sign and zero status.'
category: Math Instruction - Adjust signed value by other C-negated or !C-negated
  value.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: 0 then D = D - S, else D = D + S
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the signed value to adjust by Src or -Src, and is
  where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value (if C=0
  or !C=0) or negated value (if C=1 or !C=1) is added into Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
