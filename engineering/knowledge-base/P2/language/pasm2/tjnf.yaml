description: 'TJF or TJNF tests the value in Dest and jumps to the address described
  by Src if the result is full (-1; $FFFF_FFFF; Result: Dest is tested and if it''s
  full (or not full in syntax 2), PC is set to a new relative (#Src) or absolute (Src)
  address.'

  or not full (<> -1; <> $FFFF_FFFF).

    when: PC1
parameters:
- Dest is a register whose value is tested for full or not full.
- 'Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 20-bit augmented literal whose value is the
  absolute or relative address to set PC to. Use # for relative addressing; omit #
  for absolute addressing.'
