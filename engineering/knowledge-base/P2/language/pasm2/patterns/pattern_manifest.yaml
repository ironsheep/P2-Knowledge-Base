selection_guide: |
  PASM2 patterns focus on low-level implementation techniques
  for assembly programming on the P2 processor.
  These patterns complement the Spin2 patterns by providing
  assembly-level solutions for performance-critical code.

notes: |
  PASM2 patterns are extracted from analysis of 730 source files
  where inline assembly and pure PASM2 code was identified.
  These patterns represent common assembly programming techniques
  specific to the P2 architecture.
