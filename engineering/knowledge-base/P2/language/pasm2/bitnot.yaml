description: 'BITNOT alters the Dest bit(s) designated by Src to their inverse state.
  All other bits are left unchanged. Result: Dest bit(s) described by Src are toggled
  to their opposite state(s); the rest are left as-is. Z = original D[S[4:0]].'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Toggle bit(s) to the opposite state.
flags_affected:
  Z:
    formula: original D[S[4:0]]
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose value will have one or more bits toggled.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 10-bit augmented literal whose value identifies
  the bit(s) to modify.
- WCZ is an optional effect to update flags.
