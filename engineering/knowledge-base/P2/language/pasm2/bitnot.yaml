description: "BITNOT alters the Dest bit(s) designated by Src to their inverse state. All other bits are\
  \ left unchanged. Result: Dest bit(s) described by Src are toggled to their opposite state(s); the rest\
  \ are left as-is. Z = original D[S[4:0]].\n\nBITNOT alters the Dest bit(s) designated by Src to their\
  \ inverse state. All other bits are left unchanged.\n\nSrc[4:0] indicates the bit number (0\u201431).\
  \ For a range of bits, Src[4:0] indicates the base bit number (0\u201431) and\n\nSrc[9:5] indicates\
  \ how many contiguous bits beyond the base should be affected (1\u201331).\n\nA 9-bit literal Src is\
  \ enough to express the base bit (Src[4:0]) and a range of up to 16 contiguous bits (Src[8:5]). If\n\
  \nneeded, use the augmented literal feature (##Src) to augment Src to a 10-bit literal value\u2014 this\
  \ inserts an AUGS\n\ninstruction prior.\n\nWhen Src is a register, the register's value bits [9:0] are\
  \ used as-is to form the 10-bit ID range, unless a SETQ\n\ninstruction immediately precedes the BITNOT\
  \ instruction; substituting SETQ's Dest[4:0] in place of value bits[9:5],\n\nfor BITNOT's use.\n\nIf\
  \ the WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C and Z \uFB02ags are updated to the original state of Dest's\
  \ base bit, identi\uFB01ed by Src."

parameters:
- Dest is the register whose value will have one or more bits toggled.
- "Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 10-bit augmented literal whose value identi\uFB01es the bit(s)\

- "WCZ is an optional effect to update \uFB02ags."
