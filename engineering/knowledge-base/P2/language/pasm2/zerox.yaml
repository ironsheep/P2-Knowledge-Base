instruction: ZEROX
syntax: ZEROX   D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0111010 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: ZEROX fills the bits of Dest, above the bit indicated by Src[4:0], with zeros; i.e. zero-extending
  the value. This is C = MSB of result.
category: Math Instruction - Zero-extend value beyond designated bit.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: MSB of result
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to zero-extend above bit Src[4:0] and is where the result is
  written.
- Src is a register or 9-bit literal whose value (lower 5 bits) identifies the bit of Dest to zero-extend
  beyond.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
