description: 'SIGNX fills the bits of Dest, above the bit indicated by Src[4:0], with
  the value of that identified bit; i.e. Result: The Dest value is sign-extended above
  the bit indicated by Src and is stored in Dest. Optionally the C and Z flags are
  updated to the resulting MSB and zero status. C = MSB of result.'
category: Math Instruction - Sign-extend value beyond designated bit.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: MSB of result
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to sign-extend above bit Src[4:0] and is
  where the result is written.
- Src is a register or 9-bit literal whose value (lower 5 bits) identifies the bit
  of Dest to zero-extend beyond.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
