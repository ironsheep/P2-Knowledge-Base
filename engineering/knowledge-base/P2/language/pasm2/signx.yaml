description: "SIGNX fills the bits of Dest, above the bit indicated by Src[4:0], with the value of that\
  \ identified bit; i.e. Result: The Dest value is sign-extended above the bit indicated by Src and is\
  \ stored in Dest. Optionally the C and Z flags are updated to the resulting MSB and zero status. C =\
  \ MSB of result.\n\nSIGNX \uFB01lls the bits of Dest, above the bit indicated by Src[4:0], with the\
  \ value of that identi\uFB01ed bit; i.e.\n\nsign-extending the value. This is handy when converting\
  \ encoded or received signed values from a small bit width\n\nto a large bit with; i.e. 32 bits.\n\n\
  If the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is set to the result's MSB value.\n\nIf the\
  \ WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if the result is zero, or is cleared\
  \ (0) if it is non-zero."
flags_affected:
  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to sign-extend above bit Src[4:0] and is where the result is
  written.
- "Src is a register or 9-bit literal whose value (lower 5 bits) identi\uFB01es the bit of Dest to zero-extend\
  \ beyond."
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
