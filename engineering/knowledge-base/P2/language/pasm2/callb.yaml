instruction: CALLB
syntax: CALLB   D        {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 1101111 RAA AAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAA
timing:
  cycles: 5
  type: fixed
group: Branch A - Call
description: Write current C and Z flags and address of the next instruction into the 4-byte Hub RAM location
  at PTRA or PTRB, increment pointer, set PC to new relative or absolute address, and optionally update
  C and/or Z to new state. R = 1 then PC += A, else PC = A.
category: Flow Control Instruction - Call a subroutine; store return context in the Hub long at PTRA++
  or PTRB++.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: A
parameters:
- Addr is a symbolic reference to the target subroutine; the location to set PC to. Relative addressing
  is the default; use '\' to force absolute addressing.
- Dest is a register containing the 20-bit absolute address to set PC to and optional new C and Z states.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update the flags from Dest's upper bit states.
