description: "WAITXFI waits for a streamer-finished event to occur (unless the event flag is already set),\
  \ then clears the event Result: Wait for streamer-finished event, then clear the flag; optionally aborting\
  \ on timeout and setting C and/or Z on abort. Z = timeout.\n\nWAITXFI waits for a streamer-\uFB01nished\
  \ event to occur (unless the event \uFB02ag is already set), then clears the event\n\n\uFB02ag (unless\
  \ it's being set again by the event sensor) and resumes execution at the next instruction. Optionally,\n\
  \nWAITXFI can time-out if the streamer-\uFB01nished doesn't occur soon enough; setting C and/or Z \uFB02\
  ags and then\n\nresuming execution at the next instruction.\n\nTo set the optional timeout, insert a\
  \ SETQ (with a future System Counter target value) right before WAITXFI.\n\nThe WC, WZ, or WCZ effect\
  \ is recommended only if the optional timeout is speci\uFB01ed, in which case the C \uFB02ag and/or\n\
  \nZ \uFB02ag is set (1) if a timeout occurred before the event, or is cleared (0) if the event occurred\
  \ before the timeout.\n\nDuring a wait, the pipeline is stalled; no instructions execute and no interrupts\
  \ are processed in the cog until the\n\nwait condition ends.\n\nThe streamer-\uFB01nished event \uFB02\
  ag is set whenever the streamer runs out of commands to process. The\n\nstreamer-\uFB01nished event\
  \ \uFB02ag is cleared upon execution of XINIT, XZERO, XCONT, POLLXFI, WAITXFI, JXFI, or\n\nJNXFI instructions."
