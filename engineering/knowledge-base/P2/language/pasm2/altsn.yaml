instruction: ALTSN
syntax: ALTSN   D,{#}S
encoding: EEEE 1001010 101 DDDDDDDDD 000000000
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Register Indirection
description: 'ALTSN should be followed by SETNIBâ€” it modifies the SETNIB instruction''s Dest and Num values,
  enabling code Result: The next instruction''s pipelined Dest and Num values are altered to be (Src +
  Dest[11:3]) & $1FF, or just Dest[11:3] for syntax 2, and Dest[2:0], respectively.'
category: Indirection Instruction - Alter subsequent SETNIB instruction.
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose 12-bit value is the index, or the full nibble address, for the SETNIB instruction
  to operate on.
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 18-bit augmented literal whose value contains a base
  long address (Src[8:0]; added to index (Dest[11:3]) for SETNIB) and also an optional auto-indexer value
  (Src[17:9]; added to Dest at the end of execution).
