timing:

  type: fixed
group: Register Indirection
description: 'ALTSN should be followed by SETNIBâ€” it modifies the SETNIB instruction''s
  Dest and Num values, enabling code Result: The next instruction''s pipelined Dest
  and Num values are altered to be (Src + Dest[11:3]) & $1FF, or just Dest[11:3] for
  syntax 2, and Dest[2:0], respectively.'
category: Indirection Instruction - Alter subsequent SETNIB instruction.
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose 12-bit value is the index, or the full nibble address,
  for the SETNIB instruction to operate on.
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 18-bit augmented literal whose value
  contains a base long address (Src[8:0]; added to index (Dest[11:3]) for SETNIB)
  and also an optional auto-indexer value (Src[17:9]; added to Dest at the end of
  execution).
