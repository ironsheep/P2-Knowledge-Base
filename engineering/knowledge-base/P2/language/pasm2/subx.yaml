syntax: SUBX    D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0001101 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'SUBX subtracts the unsigned value of Src plus C from the unsigned Dest and stores the result
  into the Dest Result: Difference of unsigned Dest and unsigned Src (plus C) is stored in Dest and optionally
  the C and Z flags are updated to the extended borrow and zero status.'
category: Math Instruction - Subtract one unsigned extended value from another.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: borrow of (D - (S + C))
  Z:
    formula: Z AND (result == 0)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to subtract Src plus C from, and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value plus C is subtracted from
  Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
