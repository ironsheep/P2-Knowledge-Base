description: "XOR performs a bitwise XOR of the value in Src into that of Dest. Result: Dest XOR Src is\
  \ stored in Dest and flags are optionally updated with parity and zero status.\n\nXOR performs a bitwise\
  \ XOR of the value in Src into that of Dest.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02\
  ag is set (1) if the result contains an odd number of high (1) bits, or is\n\ncleared (0) if it contains\
  \ an even number of high bits.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set (1)\
  \ if the Dest XOR Src result equals zero, or is cleared (0) if it\n\nis non-zero."
flags_affected:
  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to bitwise XOR with Src and is the destination in which to
  write the result.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value will be bitwise XORed into
  Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
