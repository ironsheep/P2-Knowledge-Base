description: 'XOR performs a bitwise XOR of the value in Src into that of Dest. Result:
  Dest XOR Src is stored in Dest and flags are optionally updated with parity and
  zero status.'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Bitwise XOR a value with another.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: parity of result
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to bitwise XOR with Src and is the destination
  in which to write the result.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value will be
  bitwise XORed into Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
