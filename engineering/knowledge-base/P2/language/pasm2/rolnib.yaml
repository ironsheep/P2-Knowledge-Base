description: "ROLNIB reads the nibble identified by Num (0\u20137) from Src, or a nibble from the source\
  \ described by a prior ALTGN Result: Nibble Num (0\u20137) of Src, or a nibble from a source described\
  \ by prior ALTGN instruction, is rotated left into Dest.\n\nROLNIB reads the nibble identi\uFB01ed by\
  \ Num (0\u20137) from Src, or a nibble from the source described by a prior ALTGN\n\ninstruction, and\
  \ rotates it left into Dest.\n\nROLNIB achieves the same effect as two instructions\u2014 a 4-bit SHL\
  \ followed by SETNIB into nibble 0.\n\nNum (0\u20137) identi\uFB01es a value's individual nibbles, by\
  \ position, in least-signi\uFB01cant nibble order.\n\nSyntax 2 is intended for use after an ALTGN instruction;\
  \ i.e. in a loop to iteratively read a series of nibble values\n\nwithin contiguous long registers."
flags_affected:
  C:
    when: D
parameters:
- Dest is the register in which to rotate the nibble into.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value contains the target nibble
  to read.
- "Num is a 3-bit literal identifying the nibble ID (0\u20137) of Src to read."
