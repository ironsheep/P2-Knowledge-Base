syntax: CMPS    D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0010010 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'CMPS compares the signed values of Dest and Src (by subtracting Src
  from Dest) and optionally setting the C and Result: Greater/lesser and equality
  status is optionally written to the C and Z flags.'
category: Math Instruction - Compare two signed values.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: correct sign of (D - S)
  Z:
    formula: (D == S)
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to compare with that of Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is compared
  to Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
