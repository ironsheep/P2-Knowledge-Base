flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: correct sign of (D - S)

    formula: (D == S)
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to compare with that of Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is compared to Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
