description: "Streamer-LUT-RAM-rollover event flag is optionally copied into C and/or Z, then it is cleared.\n\
  \nPOLLXRL copies the state of the streamer-LUT-RAM-rollover event \uFB02ag into C and/or Z and then\
  \ clears the \uFB02ag\n\n(unless it's being set again by the event sensor).\n\nIf the WC, WZ, or WCZ\
  \ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag and/or Z \uFB02ag is updated to the state of the streamer-LUT-RAM-\n\
  \nrollover event \uFB02ag prior to clearing it.\n\nThe streamer-LUT-RAM-rollover event \uFB02ag is set\
  \ whenever location $1FF of the Lookup RAM is read by the\n\nstreamer. The streamer-LUT-RAM-rollover\
  \ event \uFB02ag is cleared upon cog start or upon execution of POLLXRL,\n\nWAITXRL, JXRL, or JNXRL\
  \ instructions."
