description: 'BMASK generates an LSB-justified bit mask (all ones) of Src+1 or Dest+1
  length and stores it in Dest. The size Result: Bit mask of size Src+1, or Dest+1
  (1â€”32 bits) is stored into Dest.'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Get 1..32-bit mask into Dest.
flags_affected:
  C:
    when: D
parameters:
- Dest is the register in which to store the generated bit mask and optionally begins
  by containing the 5-bit mask size it is requesting (syntax 2).
- Src is an optional register or 5-bit literal whose value is the size of the bit
  mask to generate.
