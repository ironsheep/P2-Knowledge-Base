description: "GETNIB reads the nibble identified by Num (0\u20137) from Src, or a nibble from the source\
  \ described by a prior ALTGN Result: Nibble Num (0\u20137) of Src, or a nibble from a source described\
  \ by prior ALTGN instruction, is written to Dest.\n\nGETNIB reads the nibble identi\uFB01ed by Num (0\u2013\
  7) from Src, or a nibble from the source described by a prior ALTGN\n\ninstruction.\n\nNum (0\u2013\
  7) identi\uFB01es a value's individual nibbles, by position, in least-signi\uFB01cant nibble order.\n\
  \nSyntax 2 is intended for use after an ALTGN instruction; i.e. in a loop to iteratively read a series\
  \ of nibble values\n\nwithin contiguous long registers."
flags_affected:
  C:
    when: D
parameters:
- Dest is the register in which to store the nibble.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value contains the target nibble
  to read.
- "Num is a 3-bit literal identifying the nibble ID (0\u20137) of Src to read."
