timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Hub Control - Cogs
description: 'COGINIT starts a new (unused) cog, a new pair of cogs (that may share
  LUT memory), or a specific cog by ID, to Result: Target cog is started, according
  to Dest, to execute code from Src. The code pointer (Src) is written to the target
  Cog''s PTRB, and optionally a data pointer or user value is written to its PTRA
  (if previous SETQ is provided).'
category: Cog Control Instruction - Start an available cog, or restart a cog by ID.
parameters:

  the ID of the desired cog to launch. If Dest is a register and WC is given, Dest

- WC is an optional effect to update the C flag with the success (0) or fail (1) status
  and triggers Dest to be overwritten with new cog's ID.
