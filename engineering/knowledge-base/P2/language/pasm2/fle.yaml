description: 'FLE sets unsigned Dest to unsigned Src if Dest is greater than Src. This is also known as
  a limit maximum Result: Unsigned Dest is set to unsigned Src if Dest was greater than Src. Optionally
  the C and Z flag indicates if the replacement happened and the zero status of the result.'
category: Math Instruction - Force unsigned value to be less than or equal to another.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: 1, else D same and C = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the unsigned value to limit to a maximum of unsigned Src, and is where
  the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose unsigned value is the upper limit
  to force upon Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
