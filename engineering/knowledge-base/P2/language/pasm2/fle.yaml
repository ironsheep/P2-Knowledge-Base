description: "FLE sets unsigned Dest to unsigned Src if Dest is greater than Src. This is also known as\

  \ unsigned Dest to unsigned Src if Dest is greater than Src. This is also known as a limit maximum\n\

  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the unsigned value to limit to a maximum of unsigned Src, and is where
  the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose unsigned value is the upper limit
  to force upon Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
