description: 'FLES sets signed Dest to signed Src if Dest is greater than Src. This
  is also known as a limit maximum function; Result: Signed Dest is set to signed
  Src if Dest was greater than Src. Optionally the C and Z flag indicates if the replacement
  happened and the zero status of the result.'
category: Math Instruction - Force signed value to be less than or equal to another.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: 1, else D same and C = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the signed value to limit to a maximum of signed Src,
  and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose signed value
  is the upper limit to force upon Dest.
