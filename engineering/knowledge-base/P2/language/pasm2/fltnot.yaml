description: 'FLTNOT sets the I/O pin(s) designated by Dest to the input direction
  and to their opposite output level(s); i.e. Result: The I/O pins described by Dest
  are set to the input direction and to their opposite output level(s); the rest are
  left as-is. Z = OUT bit.'
category: I/O Pin Instruction - Set pin(s) direction to input and toggle to the opposite
  output level.
flags_affected:
  Z:
    formula: OUT bit
parameters:
- Dest is the register, 9-bit literal, or 11-bit augmented literal whose value identifies
  the I/O pin(s) to set to the input direction and toggle to opposite output levels.
- WCZ is an optional effect to update flags.
