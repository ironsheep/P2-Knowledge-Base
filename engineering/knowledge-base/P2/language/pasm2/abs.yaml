description: "ABS determines the absolute value of Src or Dest and writes the result into Dest. Result:\
  \ Absolute Src (or Dest) value is stored in Dest.\n\nABS determines the absolute value of Src or Dest\
  \ and writes the result into Dest.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is set\
  \ (1) if the original Src or Dest value was negative, or is cleared\n\n(0) if it was positive.\n\nIf\
  \ the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if the result is zero, or is cleared\
  \ (0) if it is non-zero.\n\nLiteral Src values are zero-extended, so ABS is really best used with register\
  \ Src (or augmented Src) values."

parameters:
- Dest is the register in which to write the absolute value of Dest or Src.
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose absolute value is written
  to Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
