description: "AKPIN acknowledges the Smart Pin(s) designated by Src. This lowers the corresponding IN\
  \ signal(s) so that Result: One or more Smart Pins is acknowledged; lowering their corresponding IN\
  \ signal(s).\n\nAKPIN acknowledges the Smart Pin(s) designated by Src. This lowers the corresponding\
  \ IN signal(s) so that\n\nfuture Smart Pin events may raise them again later.\n\nSrc[5:0] indicates\
  \ the pin number (0\u201363). For a range of Smart Pins, Src[5:0] indicates the \uFB01rst pin number\
  \ (0\u201363)\n\nand Src[10:6] indicates how many contiguous pins beyond the \uFB01rst should be affected\
  \ (1\u201331).\n\nA 9-bit literal Src is enough to express the starting pin (Src[5:0]) and a range of\
  \ up to 8 contiguous pins (Src[8:6]).\n\nIf needed, use the augmented literal feature (##Src) to augment\
  \ Src to the required 11-bit literal value\u2014 this\n\ninserts an AUGS instruction prior.\n\nWhen\
  \ Src is a register, the register's value bits [10:0] are used as-is to form the 11-bit Smart Pin range,\
  \ unless a\n\nSETQ instruction immediately precedes the AKPIN instruction; substituting SETQ's Dest[4:0]\
  \ in place of value\n\nbits[10:6], for AKPIN's use.\n\nThe range calculation (from Src[5:0] up to Src[5:0]+Src[10:6])\
  \ will wrap within the same 32-pin group (DIRA or\n\nDIRB); it will not cross the port boundary."
parameters:
- "Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 11-bit augmented literal whose value identi\uFB01es the Smart\
  \ Pin(s) to acknowledge."
