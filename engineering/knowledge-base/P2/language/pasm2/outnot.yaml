description: 'OUTNOT alters the output level register''s bit(s) designated by Dest
  to their inverse state. All other bits are left Result: The I/O pin output level
  bit(s), described by Dest, are toggled to their opposite state(s); the rest are
  left as-is. Z = OUT bit.'
category: I/O Pin Instruction - Toggle pin(s) to the opposite output level.

    formula: OUT bit
parameters:
- Dest is the register, 9-bit literal, or 11-bit augmented literal whose value identifies
  the I/O pin(s) to toggle to the opposite output level.
- WCZ is an optional effect to update flags.
