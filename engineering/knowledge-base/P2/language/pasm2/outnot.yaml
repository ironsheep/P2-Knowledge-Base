  \ (1\u201331).\n\nA 9-bit literal Dest is enough to express the base pin (Dest[5:0]) and a range of\

  \ Dest to an 11-bit literal value\u2014 this inserts an\n\nAUGD instruction prior.\n\nWhen Dest is a\
  \ register, the register's value bits [10:0] are used as-is to form the 11-bit ID range, unless a SETQ\n\
