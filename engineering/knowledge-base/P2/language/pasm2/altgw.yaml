timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Register Indirection
description: 'ALTGW should be followed by GETWORD or ROLWORDâ€” it modifies the GETWORD
  / ROLWORD instruction''s Src and Result: The next instruction''s pipelined Src and
  Num fields are altered to be (Src + Dest[9:1]) & $1FF, or just Dest[9:1] for syntax
  2, and Dest[0], respectively.'
category: Indirection Instruction - Alter subsequent GETWORD / ROLWORD instruction.
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose 10-bit value is the index, or the full word address for
  the GETWORD / ROLWORD instruction to read.
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 18-bit augmented literal whose value
  contains a base long address (Src[8:0]; added to index (Dest[9:1]) for GETWORD /
  ROLWORD) and also an optional auto-indexer value (Src[17:9]; added to Dest at end
  of execution).
