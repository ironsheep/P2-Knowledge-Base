description: "ROLWORD reads the word identified by Num (0\u20131) from Src, or a word from the source\
  \ described by a prior ALTGW Result: Word Num (0\u20131) of Src, or a word from a source described by\
  \ prior ALTGW instruction, is rotated left into Dest.\n\nROLWORD reads the word identi\uFB01ed by Num\
  \ (0\u20131) from Src, or a word from the source described by a prior ALTGW\n\ninstruction, and rotates\
  \ it left into Dest.\n\nROLWORD achieves the same effect as two instructions\u2014 a 16-bit SHL followed\
  \ by SETWORD into word 0.\n\nNum (0\u20131) identi\uFB01es a value's individual words, by position,\
  \ in least-signi\uFB01cant word order.\n\nSyntax 2 is intended for use after an ALTGW instruction; i.e.\
  \ in a loop to iteratively read a series of word values\n\nwithin contiguous long registers."
flags_affected:
  C:
    when: D
parameters:
- Dest is the register in which to rotate the word into.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value contains the target word to
  read.
- "Num is a 1-bit literal identifying the nibble ID (0\u20131) of Src to read."
