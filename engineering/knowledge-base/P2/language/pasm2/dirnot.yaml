  \ indicates the pin number (0\u201363). For a range of pins, Dest[5:0] indicates the base pin number\
  \ (0\u201363)\n\nand Dest[10:6] indicates how many contiguous pins beyond the base should be affected\
  \ (1\u201331).\n\nA 9-bit literal Dest is enough to express the base pin (Dest[5:0]) and a range of\
  \ up to 8 contiguous pins (Dest[8:6]).\n\nIf needed, use the augmented literal feature (##Dest) to augment\
  \ Dest to an 11-bit literal value\u2014 this inserts an\n\nAUGD instruction prior.\n\nWhen Dest is a\
  \ register, the register's value bits [10:0] are used as-is to form the 11-bit ID range, unless a SETQ\n\
  \ninstruction immediately precedes the DIRNOT instruction; substituting SETQ's Dest[4:0] in place of\
  \ value\n\nbits[10:6], for DIRNOT's use.\n\nThe range calculation (from Dest[5:0] up to Dest[5:0]+Dest[10:6])\
  \ will wrap within the same 32-pin group (DIRA or\n\nDIRB); it will not cross the port boundary.\n\n\
  If the WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C and Z \uFB02ags are updated to the original state of DIRA\
  \ / DIRB's base bit,\n\nidenti\uFB01ed by Dest."
