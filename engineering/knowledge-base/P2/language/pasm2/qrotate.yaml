description: Rotate a 32-bit signed (X, Y) point around origin (0, 0) by a specified angle. X coordinate comes from D operand, Y coordinate from SETQ value (or 0 if SETQ not used). Angle specified in S operand. Results retrieved via GETQX (X) and GETQY (Y) instructions 55 clocks later.
long_description: |
  The QROTATE instruction performs point rotation using the P2's 54-stage pipelined CORDIC solver. It rotates a 32-bit signed (X, Y) coordinate pair around the origin (0, 0) by a specified angle, producing new 32-bit signed (X, Y) results.
  
  The instruction takes the X coordinate from the D operand and the Y coordinate from the SETQ value (or 32'b0 if SETQ was not used). The rotation angle is specified in the S operand using P2's standard angle units where $00000000 = 0°, $40000000 = 90°, $80000000 = 180°, and $C0000000 = 270°.
  
  After 55 clocks, the rotated coordinates can be retrieved using GETQX for the new X coordinate and GETQY for the new Y coordinate.
  
  This instruction can also be used for polar to cartesian conversion by setting the X coordinate (D) to the length, Y coordinate (SETQ) to 0, and the angle (S) to the desired angle.
  
  Common applications include graphics transformations, signal processing rotations, and coordinate system conversions.
