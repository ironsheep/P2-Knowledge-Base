description: "POLLXRO copies the state of the streamer NCO rollover event flag into C and/or Z and then\
  \ clears the flag (unless Result: Streamer-NCO-rollover event flag is optionally copied into C and/or\
  \ Z, then it is cleared.\n\nPOLLXRO copies the state of the streamer NCO rollover event \uFB02ag into\
  \ C and/or Z and then clears the \uFB02ag (unless\n\nit's being set again by the event sensor).\n\n\
  If the WC, WZ, or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag and/or Z \uFB02ag is updated to the state\
  \ of the streamer-NCO-\n\nrollover event \uFB02ag prior to clearing it.\n\nThe streamer-NCO-rollover\
  \ event \uFB02ag is set whenever the streamer's numerically-controlled oscillator (NCO) rolls\n\nover.\
  \ The streamer-NCO-rollover event \uFB02ag is cleared upon execution of XINIT, XZERO, XCONT, POLLXRO,\n\
  \nWAITXRO, JXRO, or JNXRO instructions."
