description: "The bits of Dest are shifted left by Src bits, inserting C as new LSBs.\n\nRCL shifts Dest's\
  \ binary value left by Src places (0\u201331 bits) and sets the new LSBs to C.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect\
  \ is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is updated to the value of the last bit shifted out if Src is 1\u2013\
  31, or to\n\nDest[31] if Src is 0.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set\
  \ (1) if the Dest result equals zero, or is cleared (0) if it is\n\nnon-zero."

  C:
    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[31]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to rotate carry left by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bit positions to rotate.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
