timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'SUBR subtracts the unsigned Dest from the unsigned Src and stores the
  result into the Dest register. This is the Result: Difference of unsigned Src and
  unsigned Dest is stored in Dest and optionally the C and Z flags are updated to
  the borrow and zero status.'
category: Math Instruction - Subtract one unsigned value from another (in reverse
  order to SUB).
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: borrow of (S - D)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to subtract from Src, and is where the result
  is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is subtracted
  by Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
