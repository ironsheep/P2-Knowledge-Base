description: "SUBR subtracts the unsigned Dest from the unsigned Src and stores the result into the Dest\
  \ register. This is the Result: Difference of unsigned Src and unsigned Dest is stored in Dest and optionally\
  \ the C and Z flags are updated to the borrow and zero status.\n\nSUBR subtracts the unsigned Dest from\
  \ the unsigned Src and stores the result into the Dest register. This is the\n\nreverse of the subtraction\
  \ order of SUB.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is set (1) if the subtraction\
  \ results in a 32-bit under\uFB02ow (unsigned\n\nborrow), or is cleared (0) if no borrow.\n\nIf the\
  \ WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if the result of Dest - Src is zero,\
  \ or is cleared (0) if it is\n\nnon-zero."
flags_affected:
  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to subtract from Src, and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is subtracted by Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
