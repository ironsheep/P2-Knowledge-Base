description: 'AND or ANDN performs a bitwise AND of the value in Src (or !Src) into that of Dest. Result:
  Dest AND Src (or Dest AND !Src) is stored in Dest and flags are optionally updated with parity and zero
  status.'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Bitwise AND a value with another, or with the NOT of another.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: parity of result
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to bitwise AND with Src (or with !Src) and is the destination
  in which to write the result.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value (or inverse value) will be
  bitwise ANDed into Dest.
