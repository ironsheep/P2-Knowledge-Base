description: 'AND or ANDN performs a bitwise AND of the value in Src (or !Src) into that of Dest. Result:
  Dest AND Src (or Dest AND !Src) is stored in Dest and flags are optionally updated with parity and zero
  status.


  If the WC or WCZ effect is specified, the C flag is set (1) if the result contains an odd number of
  high (1) bits, or is cleared (0) if it contains an even number of high bits.


  If the WZ or WCZ effect is specified, the Z flag is set (1) if the Dest AND Src (or Dest AND !Src) equals
  zero, or is cleared (0) if it is non-zero.'
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: parity of result
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to bitwise AND with Src (or with !Src) and is the destination
  in which to write the result.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value (or inverse value) will be
  bitwise ANDed into Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
