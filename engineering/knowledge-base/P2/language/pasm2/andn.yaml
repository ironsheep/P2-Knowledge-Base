description: 'AND or ANDN performs a bitwise AND of the value in Src (or !Src) into
  that of Dest. Result: Dest AND Src (or Dest AND !Src) is stored in Dest and flags
  are optionally updated with parity and zero status.'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Bitwise AND a value with another, or with the
  NOT of another.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: parity of result
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to bitwise AND with Src (or with !Src)
  and is the destination in which to write the result.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value (or inverse
  value) will be bitwise ANDed into Dest.
