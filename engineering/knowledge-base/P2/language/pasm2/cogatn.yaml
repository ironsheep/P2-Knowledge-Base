  \n(1) bits indicate the cog(s) to signal. The receiving cog(s) then latch the signal, setting an internal\
  \ \uFB02ag, and can\n\nuse any of the attention monitor instructions (JATN, JNATN, POLLATN, WAITATN)\

parameters:
- Dest is the register or 9-bit literal whose value (lower 8-bit pattern) indicates which cogs to signal.
