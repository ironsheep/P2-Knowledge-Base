instruction: INCMOD
syntax: INCMOD  D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0111000 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'INCMOD compares Dest with Srcâ€” if not equal, it increments Dest; otherwise it sets Dest
  equal to 0. If Dest Result: If Dest was not equal to Src, it is incremented by 1; otherwise Dest is
  reset to 0. Optionally, C and Z are updated to indicate reset and zero result status.'
category: Math Instruction - Increment with modulus.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: 1, else D = D + 1 and C = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to increment up to Src with modulus, and is where the result
  is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is the modulus limit to apply
  to Dest's increment operation.
