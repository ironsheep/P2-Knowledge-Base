  \ set), then clears the Result: Wait for pin-pattern-detected event, then clear the flag; optionally\
  \ aborting on timeout and setting C and/or Z on abort. Z = timeout.\n\nWAITPAT waits for a pin-pattern-detected\
  \ event to occur (unless the event \uFB02ag is already set), then clears the\n\nevent \uFB02ag (unless\
  \ it's being set again by the event sensor) and resumes execution at the next instruction.\n\nOptionally,\
  \ WAITPAT can time-out if the pin-pattern-detected event doesn't occur soon enough; setting C and/or\
  \ Z\n\n\uFB02ags and then resuming execution at the next instruction.\n\nTo set the optional timeout,\
  \ insert a SETQ (with a future System Counter target value) right before WAITPAT.\n\nThe WC, WZ, or\
  \ WCZ effect is recommended only if the optional timeout is speci\uFB01ed, in which case the C \uFB02\
  ag and/or\n\nZ \uFB02ag is set (1) if a timeout occurred before the event, or is cleared (0) if the\
  \ event occurred before the timeout.\n\nDuring a wait, the pipeline is stalled; no instructions execute\
  \ and no interrupts are processed in the cog until the\n\nwait condition ends.\n\nThe pin-pattern-detected\
  \ event \uFB02ag is set whenever the masked input pins match or don't match the pattern\n\ndescribed\
  \ by a previous SETPAT instruction. The pin-pattern-detected event \uFB02ag is cleared upon execution\
  \ of\n\nSETPAT, POLLPAT, WAITPAT, JPAT, or JNPAT instructions."
