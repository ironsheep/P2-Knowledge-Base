description: "ADDS sums the two signed values of Dest and Src together and stores the result into the\
  \ Dest register. If Src is a Result: Sum of signed Src and signed Dest is stored in Dest.\n\nADDS sums\
  \ the two signed values of Dest and Src together and stores the result into the Dest register. If Src\
  \ is a\n\n9-bit literal, its value is interpreted as positive (0-511; it is not sign-extended) \u2014\
  \ use ##Value (or insert a prior\n\nAUGS instruction) for a 32-bit signed value; negative or positive.\n\
  \nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is set (1) if the summation results in a\
  \ signed over\uFB02ow (signed\n\ncarry), or is cleared (0) if no over\uFB02ow.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect\
  \ is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if the result of Dest + Src is zero, or is cleared (0)\
  \ if it is\n\nnon-zero.\n\nTo add signed, multi-long values, use ADD (not ADDS) followed possibly by\
  \ ADDX, and \uFB01nally ADDSX as described\n\nin Adding Two Multi-Long Values."
flags_affected:
  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to add Src to, and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is added into Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
