description: "ADDSX sums the signed values of Dest and Src plus C together and stores the result into\

  \ sums the signed values of Dest and Src plus C together and stores the result into the Dest register.\
  \ The\n\nADDSX instruction is used to perform signed multi-long (extended) addition, such as 64-bit\
  \ addition.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is set (1) if the result is\
  \ negative (Result[31] = 1), or is cleared (0) if\n\npositive. Use WC or WCZ on preceding ADD and ADDX\
  \ instructions for proper \uFB01nal C \uFB02ag.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02\
  ag is set (1) if Z was previously set and the result of Dest + Src + C is\n\nzero, or it is cleared\
  \ (0) if non-zero. Use WZ or WCZ on preceding ADD and ADDX instructions for proper \uFB01nal Z \uFB02\
  ag.\n\nTo add signed multi-long values, use ADD (not ADDS) followed possibly by ADDX, and \uFB01nally\
  \ ADDSX as described in\n\nAdding Two Multi-Long Values."
flags_affected:
  Z: (Result = 0)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to add Src pluc C to, and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value plus C is added into Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
