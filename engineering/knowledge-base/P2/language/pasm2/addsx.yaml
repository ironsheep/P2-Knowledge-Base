timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'ADDSX sums the signed values of Dest and Src plus C together and stores
  the result into the Dest register. The Result: Sum of signed Src plus C and signed
  Dest is stored in Dest.'
category: Math Instruction - Add two signed extended values.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: correct sign of (D + S + C)
  Z:
    formula: Z AND (result == 0)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to add Src pluc C to, and is where the result
  is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value plus C
  is added into Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
