description: 'FGE sets unsigned Dest to unsigned Src if Dest is less than Src. This
  is also known as a limit minimum function; Result: Unsigned Dest is set to unsigned
  Src if Dest was less than Src. Optionally the C and Z flag indicates if the replacement
  happened and the zero status of the result.'
category: Math Instruction - Force unsigned value to be greater than or equal to another.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: 1, else D same and C = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the unsigned value to limit to a minimum of unsigned
  Src, and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose unsigned value
  is the lower limit to force upon Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
