parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the unsigned value to limit to a minimum of unsigned Src, and is where
  the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose unsigned value is the lower limit
  to force upon Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
