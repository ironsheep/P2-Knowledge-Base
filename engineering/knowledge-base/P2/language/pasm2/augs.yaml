description: 'AUGS is an assistant instruction to aid with literal values that exceed
  9 bits. Most PASM2 instructions have 9 bits Result: The 23-bit value formed from
  Src is queued to prefix the next literal Src occurrence (#Src) to form a 32-bit
  literal for that instruction; interrupts are also temporarily disabled.'
category: Augmentation Instruction - Augment next literal Src to 32-bits.
parameters:
- Src is a 32-bit literal whose upper 23 bits are prepended to the next literal Src
  occurrence.
