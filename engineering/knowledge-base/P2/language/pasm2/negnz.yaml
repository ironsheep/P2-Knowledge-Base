timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'NEGNZ negates Src (syntax 1) or Dest (syntax 2) if !Z = 1 and stores the result in the Dest
  register. If !Z = 0, the Src Result: The Src or Dest value, possibly negated according to !Z, is stored
  into Dest and optionally the C and Z flags are updated to the resulting sign and zero status.'
category: Math Instruction - Negate value according to !Z.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: MSB of result
  Z:
    formula: 0 then D = -D, else D = D
parameters:
- Dest is a register to receive the Src or -Src value (syntax 1), or contains the value to negate (syntax
  2) according to !C.
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value (if !C=0) or negated
  value (if !C=1) is stored into Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
