description: "SUB subtracts the unsigned Src from the unsigned Dest and stores the result into the Dest\
  \ register. Result: Difference of unsigned Dest and unsigned Src is stored in Dest and optionally the\
  \ C and Z flags are updated to the borrow and zero status.\n\nSUB subtracts the unsigned Src from the\
  \ unsigned Dest and stores the result into the Dest register.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01\
  ed, the C \uFB02ag is set (1) if the subtraction results in a 32-bit under\uFB02ow (unsigned\n\nborrow),\
  \ or is cleared (0) if no borrow.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set\
  \ (1) if the result of Dest - Src is zero, or is cleared (0) if it is\n\nnon-zero.\n\nTo subtract unsigned,\
  \ multi-long values, use SUB followed by SUBX as described in Subtracting Two Multi-Long\n\nValues.\
  \ SUB and SUBX are also used in subtracting signed, multi-long values with SUBSX ending the sequence."
flags_affected:
  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to subtract Src from, and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is subtracted from Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
