  \ set (1) if Dest equals Src.\n\nTo compare unsigned, multi-long values, use CMP (instead) followed\
  \ by CMPX as described in Comparing Two\n\nMulti-Long Values."

parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to compare with that of Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is compared to Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
