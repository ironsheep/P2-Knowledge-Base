description: 'CMP compares the unsigned values of Dest and Src (by subtracting Dest
  from Src) and optionally setting the C Result: Greater/lesser and equality status
  is optionally written to the C and Z flags.'

  C:
    formula: borrow of (S - D)
  Z:
    formula: (D == S)
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to compare with that of Src.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is compared
  to Dest.
