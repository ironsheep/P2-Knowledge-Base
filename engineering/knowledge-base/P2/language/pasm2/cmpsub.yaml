instruction: CMPSUB
syntax: CMPSUB  D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0010111 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'CMPSUB compares the unsigned values of Dest and Src, and if Src is less than or equal to
  Dest then it is Result: Dest is decremented by Src unless it is less than Src, and the comparison results
  are optionally written to the C and Z flags.'
category: Math Instruction - Compare two unsigned values and subtract the second if it is lesser or equal.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: 1, else D same and C = 0
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to compare with Src and is the destination written to if a
  subtraction is performed.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is compared with and possibly
  subtracted from Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
