description: 'ENCOD stores the bit position value (0â€”31) of the top-most high bit (1) of Src, or Dest,
  into Dest. If the value to Result: The bit position value of the top-most high bit (1) in Src, or Dest,
  is stored in Dest.'

parameters:
- Dest is the register in which to store the encoded bit position value and optionally begins by containing
  the 32-bit value it is encoding (syntax 2).
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is to be encoded
  into a bit position.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
