group: Bit Operation Instruction - Rotate carry and zero flags left into value (2-bit rotate left).
description: "RCZL shifts Dest's binary value left by two places and sets Dest[1] to C and Dest[0] to\
  \ Z. Result: The bits of Dest are shifted left by two places and C and Z are inserted as new LSBs.\n\
  \nRCZL shifts Dest's binary value left by two places and sets Dest[1] to C and Dest[0] to Z.\n\nIf the\
  \ WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is updated to the original Dest[31] state.\n\nIf\
  \ the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z is \uFB02ag is updated to the original Dest[30] state."
flags_affected:
  C: D[31] D[30] 2
parameters:
- "Dest is the register containing the value to rotate the carry and zero \uFB02ags left into."
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
