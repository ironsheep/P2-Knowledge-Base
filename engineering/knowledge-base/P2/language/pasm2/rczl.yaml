description: 'RCZL shifts Dest''s binary value left by two places and sets Dest[1] to C and Dest[0] to
  Z. Result: The bits of Dest are shifted left by two places and C and Z are inserted as new LSBs.'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Rotate carry and zero flags left into value (2-bit rotate left).
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: D[31], Z = D[30]
    when: D
  Z:
    formula: D[30]
    when: D[31]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to rotate the carry and zero flags left into.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
