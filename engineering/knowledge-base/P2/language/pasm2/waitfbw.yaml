description: "WAITFBW waits for a FIFO-interface-block-wrap event to occur (unless the event flag is already\
  \ set), then clears Result: Wait for FIFO-interface-block-wrap event, then clear the flag; optionally\
  \ aborting on timeout and setting C and/or Z on abort. Z = timeout.\n\nWAITFBW waits for a FIFO-interface-block-wrap\
  \ event to occur (unless the event \uFB02ag is already set), then clears\n\nthe event \uFB02ag (unless\
  \ it's being set again by the event sensor) and resumes execution at the next instruction.\n\nOptionally,\
  \ WAITFBW can time-out if the FIFO-interface-block-wrap event doesn't occur soon enough; setting C\n\
  \nand/or Z \uFB02ags and then resuming execution at the next instruction.\n\nTo set the optional timeout,\
  \ insert a SETQ (with a future System Counter target value) right before WAITFBW.\n\nThe WC, WZ, or\
  \ WCZ effect is recommended only if the optional timeout is speci\uFB01ed, in which case the C \uFB02\
  ag and/or\n\nZ \uFB02ag is set (1) if a timeout occurred before the event, or is cleared (0) if the\
  \ event occurred before the timeout.\n\nDuring a wait, the pipeline is stalled; no instructions execute\
  \ and no interrupts are processed in the cog until the\n\nwait condition ends.\n\nThe FIFO-interface-block-wrap\
  \ event \uFB02ag is set whenever the Hub RAM FIFO interface exhausts its block count\n\nand reloads\
  \ its block count and start address. The FIFO-interface-block-wrap event \uFB02ag is cleared upon execution\n\
