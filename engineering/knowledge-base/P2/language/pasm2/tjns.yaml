timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Flow Control Instruction - Test value and jump if signed or not signed.
description: 'TJS or TJNS tests the value in Dest and jumps to the address described
  by Src if the result is signed (Dest[31] = 1) Result: Dest is tested and if it''s
  signed (or not signed in syntax 2), PC is set to a new relative (#Src) or absolute
  (Src) address.'
parameters:
- Dest is a register whose value is tested for sign or no sign.
- 'Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 20-bit augmented literal whose value is the
  absolute or relative address to set PC to. Use # for relative addressing; omit #
  for absolute addressing.'
