description: "SAL shifts Dest's binary value left by Src places (0\u201331 bits) and sets the new LSBs\
  \ to that of the original Dest[0]. Result: The bits of Dest are shifted left by Src bits, extending\
  \ Dest[0] into new rightmost bits.\n\nSAL shifts Dest's binary value left by Src places (0\u201331 bits)\
  \ and sets the new LSBs to that of the original Dest[0].\n\nSAL is the complement of SAR for bit streams\
  \ but not for math operations\u2014 use SHL instead for swift 32-bit\n\ninteger multiplication by a\
  \ power-of-two.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is updated to the value\
  \ of the last bit shifted out (effectively C =\n\nresult bit \"32\") if Src is 1\u201331, or to Dest[31]\
  \ if Src is 0.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if the Dest result\
  \ equals zero, or is cleared (0) if it is\n\nnon-zero."

  C:
    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[31]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to arithmetically left shift by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bits to arithmetically shift
  left.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
