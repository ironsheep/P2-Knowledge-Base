flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[0]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to rotate right by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bit positions to rotate.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
