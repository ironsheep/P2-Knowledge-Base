description: 'ROR rotates Dest''s binary value right by Src places (0â€“31 bits). All LSBs rotated out are
  moved into the new Result: The bits of Dest are rotated right by Src bits; any departing LSBs are moved
  into MSBs.'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Rotate bits right.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[0]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to rotate right by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bit positions to rotate.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
