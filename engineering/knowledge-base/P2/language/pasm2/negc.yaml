description: 'NEGC negates Src (syntax 1) or Dest (syntax 2) if C = 1 and stores the result in the Dest
  register. If C = 0, the Src Result: The Src or Dest value, possibly negated according to C, is stored
  into Dest and optionally the C and Z flags are updated to the resulting sign and zero status.'
category: Math Instruction - Negate value according to C.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: 1 then D = -D, else D = D
parameters:
- Dest is a register to receive the Src or -Src value (syntax 1), or contains the value to negate (syntax
  2) according to C.
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value (if C=0) or negated
  value (if C=1) is stored into Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
