instruction: SUBSX
syntax: SUBSX   D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0001111 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'SUBSX subtracts the signed value of Src plus C from the signed Dest
  and stores the result into the Dest register. Result: Difference of signed Dest
  and signed Src (plus C) is stored in Dest and optionally the C and Z flags are updated
  to the extended sign and zero status.'
category: Math Instruction - Subtract one signed extended value from another.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: correct sign of (D - (S + C))
  Z:
    formula: Z AND (result == 0)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to subtract Src plus C from, and is where
  the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value plus C
  is subtracted from Dest.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
