  type: fixed
group: Math Instruction - Subtract one signed extended value from another.
description: "SUBSX subtracts the signed value of Src plus C from the signed Dest and stores the result\
  \ into the Dest register. Result: Difference of signed Dest and signed Src (plus C) is stored in Dest\
  \ and optionally the C and Z flags are updated to the extended sign and zero status.\n\nSUBSX subtracts\
  \ the signed value of Src plus C from the signed Dest and stores the result into the Dest register.\n\
  \nThe SUBSX instruction is used to perform signed multi-long (extended) subtraction, such as 64-bit\
  \ subtraction.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is set (1) if the result\
  \ is negative (Result[31] = 1), or is cleared (0) if\n\npositive. Use WC or WCZ on preceding SUB and\
  \ SUBX instructions for proper \uFB01nal C \uFB02ag.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the\
  \ Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if Z was previously set and the result of Dest - (Src + C) is\n\nzero, or it\
  \ is cleared (0) if non-zero. Use WZ or WCZ on preceding SUB and SUBX instructions for proper \uFB01\
  nal Z \uFB02ag.\n\nTo subtract signed multi-long values, use SUB (not SUBS) followed possibly by SUBX,\
  \ and \uFB01nally SUBSX as\n\ndescribed in Subtracting Two Multi-Long Values."
flags_affected:
  Z: (Result = 0)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the value to subtract Src plus C from, and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value plus C is subtracted from
  Dest.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
