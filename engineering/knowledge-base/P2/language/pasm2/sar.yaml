description: The bits of Dest are shifted right by Src bits, extending Dest[31] (the
  sign bit) into new leftmost bits.
category: Math Instruction - Divide signed 32-bit integer by power-of-two; a.k.a shift
  bits right, extending the MSB.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[0]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to arithmetically right shift by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bits to arithmetically
  shift right.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
