description: "The bits of Dest are shifted right by Src bits, extending Dest[31] (the sign bit) into new\
  \ leftmost bits.\n\nSAR shifts Dest's binary value right by Src places (0\u201331 bits) and sets the\
  \ new MSBs to that of the original\n\nDest[31]; preserving the sign of a signed integer. This is useful\
  \ for bit stream manipulation and for swift division\u2014\n\nit is similar to SHR for swift division\
  \ by a power-of-two, but is safe for both signed and unsigned integers.\n\nIf the WC or WCZ effect is\
  \ speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is updated to the value of the last bit shifted out (effectively C =\n\
  \nresult bit \"-1\") if Src is 1\u201331, or to Dest[0] if Src is 0.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01\
  ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if the Dest result equals zero, or is cleared (0) if it is\n\nnon-zero."
flags_affected:

    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[0]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to arithmetically right shift by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bits to arithmetically shift
  right.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
