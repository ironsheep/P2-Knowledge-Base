  \ the new LSBs to 0. This is useful for\n\nbit-stream manipulation as well as for swift multiplication;\
  \ signed or unsigned 32-bit integer multiplication by a\n\npower-of-two. Care must be taken for power-of-two\

  \nIf the WC or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is updated to the value of the last bit shifted\

  \ the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the Z \uFB02ag is set (1) if the Dest result equals zero, or\

    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[31]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to left shift by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bits to shift left.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
