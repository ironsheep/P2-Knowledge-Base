  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'SHL shifts Dest''s binary value left by Src places (0â€“31 bits) and sets the new LSBs to
  0. This is useful for Result: The bits of Dest are shifted left by Src bits, inserting zeros (0) as
  new rightmost bits.'
category: Bit Operation / Math Instruction - Shift bits left; a.k.a. multiply 32-bit integer by power-of-two.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[31]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to left shift by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bits to shift left.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
