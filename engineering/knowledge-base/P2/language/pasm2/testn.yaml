instruction: TESTN
syntax: TESTN   D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0111111 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'TESTN determines the parity (number of high (1) bits) and the zero or non-zero state of
  Dest bitwise ANDed with Result: The parity and zero-state of Dest bitwise ANDed with !Src is stored
  in the C and Z flags. C = parity of (D & !S).'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Test D by bitwise ANDing with !S to affect flags only.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: parity of (D & !S)
  Z:
    formula: ((D & !S) == 0)
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose value will be tested.
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose inverse value is ANDed
  with Dest.
- WC, WZ, and WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
