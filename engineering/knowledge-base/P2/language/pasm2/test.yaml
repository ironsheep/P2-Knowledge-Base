description: 'TEST determines the parity (number of high (1) bits) and the zero or non-zero state of Dest,
  or of Dest bitwise Result: The parity and zero-state of Dest, or of Dest bitwise ANDed with Src, is
  stored in the C and Z flags. C = parity of (D & S).'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Test D, or bitwise AND D with S, to affect flags.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: parity of (D & S)
  Z:
    formula: ((D & S) == 0)
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose value will be tested.
- Src is an optional register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value is ANDed with Dest.
- WC, WZ, and WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
