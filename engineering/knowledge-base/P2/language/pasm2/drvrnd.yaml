description: 'DRVRND sets the I/O pin(s) designated by Dest to the output direction
  and with output level(s) set randomly low Result: The I/O pins described by Dest
  are set to the output direction and each output level is set randomly low or high;
  the rest are left as-is. Z = OUT bit.'
category: I/O Pin Instruction - Set pin(s) direction to output and output level to
  random low/high.
flags_affected:
  Z:
    formula: OUT bit
parameters:
- Dest is the register, 9-bit literal, or 11-bit augmented literal whose value identifies
  the I/O pin(s) to set to the output direction and with output level(s) set randomly
  to low or high.
- WCZ is an optional effect to update flags.
