instruction: MUXNZ
syntax: MUXNZ   D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0101111 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Bit Operation Instructions - Set discrete bits to Z or !Z
description: 'MUXZ or MUXNZ alters the Dest bit(s) designated by Src (high bits) to
  equal the state, or inverse state, of the Z flag. Result: Dest bit(s) described
  by Src are set to Z or !Z; the rest are left as-is. Flags are optionally updated
  with parity and zero status of the result.'
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: parity of result
parameters:
- Dest is the register whose value will have one or more bits set to Z or !Z.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 32-bit augmented literal whose value identifies
  the bit(s) to modify.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ is an optional effect to update flags.
