    formula: (S == 0) | (D == 0)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the 16-bit value to multiply with Src, and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 16-bit augmented literal whose value is multiplied into Dest.
- "WZ is an optional effect to update the Z \uFB02ag."
