description: The 32-bit unsigned product of the 16-bit Dest and Src multiplication is stored into Dest
  and optionally the Z flag is updated to the Dest or Src zero status. D = unsigned (D[15:0] * S[15:0]).
category: Math Instruction - Multiply unsigned 16-bit x 16-bit values.
flags_affected:
  Z:
    formula: (S == 0) | (D == 0)
parameters:
- Dest is a register containing the 16-bit value to multiply with Src, and is where the result is written.
- Src is a register, 9-bit literal, or 16-bit augmented literal whose value is multiplied into Dest.
- WZ is an optional effect to update the Z flag.
