description: "RCR shifts Dest's binary value right by Src places (0\u201331 bits) and sets the new MSBs\
  \ to C. Result: The bits of Dest are shifted right by Src bits, inserting C as new MSBs.\n\nRCR shifts\

  \ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C \uFB02ag is updated to the value of the last bit shifted out\
  \ if Src is 1\u201331, or to\n\nDest[0] if Src is 0.\n\nIf the WZ or WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the\

flags_affected:
  Z: Result = 0
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to rotate carry right by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bit positions to rotate.
- "WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update \uFB02ags."
