instruction: RCR
syntax: RCR     D,{#}S   {WC/WZ/WCZ}
encoding: EEEE 0000100 CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS
timing:
  cycles: 2
  type: fixed
group: Math and Logic
description: 'RCR shifts Dest''s binary value right by Src places (0â€“31 bits) and
  sets the new MSBs to C. Result: The bits of Dest are shifted right by Src bits,
  inserting C as new MSBs.'
category: Bit Operation Instruction - Rotate carry flag right into value.
flags_affected:
  C:
    formula: last bit shifted out if S[4:0] > 0, else D[0]
parameters:
- Dest is the register containing the value to rotate carry right by Src bits.
- Src is a register or 5-bit literal whose value indicates the number of bit positions
  to rotate.
- WC, WZ, or WCZ are optional effects to update flags.
