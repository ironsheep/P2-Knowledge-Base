description: "DRVNOT sets the I/O pin(s) designated by Dest to the output direction and to their opposite\
  \ output level(s); i.e. Result: The I/O pins described by Dest are set to the output direction and to\
  \ their opposite output level(s); the rest are left as-is. Z = OUT bit.\n\nDRVNOT sets the I/O pin(s)\
  \ designated by Dest to the output direction and to their opposite output level(s); i.e.\n\nalters the\
  \ pin's direction and output registers. All other pins are left unchanged. This instruction can affect\
  \ one or\n\nmore of the bits within the DIRA or DIRB and OUTA or OUTB registers.\n\nDRVNOT achieves\
  \ the same effect as two instructions\u2014 OUTNOT followed by DIRH.\n\nDest[5:0] indicates the pin\
  \ number (0\u201363). For a range of pins, Dest[5:0] indicates the base pin number (0\u201363)\n\nand\
  \ Dest[10:6] indicates how many contiguous pins beyond the base should be affected (1\u201331).\n\n\
  A 9-bit literal Dest is enough to express the base pin (Dest[5:0]) and a range of up to 8 contiguous\
  \ pins (Dest[8:6]).\n\nIf needed, use the augmented literal feature (##Dest) to augment Dest to an 11-bit\
  \ literal value\u2014 this inserts an\n\nAUGD instruction prior.\n\nWhen Dest is a register, the register's\
  \ value bits [10:0] are used as-is to form the 11-bit ID range, unless a SETQ\n\ninstruction immediately\
  \ precedes the DRVNOT instruction; substituting SETQ's Dest[4:0] in place of value\n\nbits[10:6], for\
  \ DRVNOT's use.\n\nThe range calculation (from Dest[5:0] up to Dest[5:0]+Dest[10:6]) will wrap within\
  \ the same 32-pin group (DIRA or\n\nDIRB and OUTA or OUTB); it will not cross the port boundary.\n\n\
  If the WCZ effect is speci\uFB01ed, the C and Z \uFB02ags are updated to the original state of OUTA\
  \ / OUTB's base bit,\n\nidenti\uFB01ed by Dest."

- DRVNOT {#}Dest {WCZ}
- DRVNOT sets the I/O pin(s) designated by Dest to the output direction and to their opposite output level(s);
  i.e.
- instruction immediately precedes the DRVNOT instruction; substituting SETQ's Dest[4:0] in place of value
- bits[10:6], for DRVNOT's use.
