method: BYTESWAP
type: method
description: |
  Swap byte values between two memory locations
category: Memory Operations
syntax: "BYTESWAP(Address1, Address2)"
parameters:
  - name: "Address1"
    type: "address"
    description: "First hub RAM address containing byte to swap"
  - name: "Address2"
    type: "address"
    description: "Second hub RAM address containing byte to swap"
returns:
  type: "void"
  description: "No return value"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Swap two byte values
      BYTESWAP(@value1, @value2)
    description: "Exchange byte values between variables"
  - code: |
      ' Reverse byte order in array
      repeat i from 0 to size/2-1
        BYTESWAP(@array[i], @array[size-1-i])
    description: "Reverse array using byte swapping"
  - code: |
      ' Swap bytes at specific hub addresses
      BYTESWAP($1000, $2000)
    description: "Exchange bytes at hub memory locations"
notes:
  - "Atomically exchanges the byte values"
  - "Both addresses must be valid hub RAM locations"
  - "No temporary variable needed for swap"
  - "Efficient single-operation exchange"
