method: WORDMOVE
type: method
description: |
  Copy words from one memory location to another
category: Memory Operations
syntax: "WORDMOVE(DestAddress, SourceAddress, Count)"
parameters:
  - name: "DestAddress"
    type: "address"
    description: "Hub RAM destination starting address for word copy"
  - name: "SourceAddress" 
    type: "address"
    description: "Hub RAM source starting address for word copy"
  - name: "Count"
    type: "integer"
    description: "Number of words (16-bit values) to copy"
returns:
  type: "void"
  description: "No return value"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Copy 100 words from source to destination
      WORDMOVE(@dest_array, @source_array, 100)
    description: "Copy 100 words between arrays"
  - code: |
      ' Shift array elements up by one word
      WORDMOVE(@array[1], @array[0], 99)
    description: "Shift array elements with overlap handling"
notes:
  - "Automatically handles overlapping source and destination regions"
  - "Copies in appropriate direction to preserve data integrity"
  - "Each word is 2 bytes (16 bits)"
  - "Addresses must be word-aligned for optimal performance"
  - "Count of 0 copies no data"
timing:
  description: "Varies based on count and hub timing"
  cycles: "~8 + (count * 2) clock cycles typical"
