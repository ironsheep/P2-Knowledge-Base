examples:
  - code: |
      ' Calculate natural log
      ln_value := QLOG($1000_0000)  ' ln(0.0625)
      ' Result in 5.27 fixed-point format
    description: "Basic logarithm calculation"
  - code: |
      ' Calculate log base 10
      log10_value := QLOG(value) * 39457 >> 17  ' Convert ln to log10
    description: "Convert natural log to log base 10"
  - code: |
      ' Audio decibel calculation
      db := QLOG(amplitude) * 1717 >> 12  ' 20*log10(amplitude)
