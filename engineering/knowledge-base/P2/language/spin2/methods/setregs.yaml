  Copy hub RAM to cog registers
category: Miscellaneous
syntax: "SETREGS(HubAddress, CogAddress, Count)"
parameters:
  - name: "HubAddress"
    type: "address"
    description: "Hub RAM source address"
  - name: "CogAddress"
    type: "integer"
    description: "Starting cog register address (0-511)"
  - name: "Count"
    type: "integer"
    description: "Number of longs to copy"
returns:
  type: "void"
  description: "No return value"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Load PASM code into cog
      SETREGS(@pasm_code, $100, 50)  ' Load 50 longs
    description: "Load PASM code to cog RAM"
  - code: |
      ' Restore saved registers
      VAR
        LONG saved_regs[16]
      
      SETREGS(@saved_regs, $1F0, 16)  ' Restore $1F0-$1FF
    description: "Restore cog register state"
  - code: |
      ' Initialize PASM variables
      VAR
        LONG init_data[10]
      
      repeat i from 0 to 9
        init_data[i] := i * 100
      SETREGS(@init_data, $100, 10)

notes:
  - "Copies from hub RAM to cog RAM"
  - "Cog addresses are 0-511 (2KB)"
  - "Each register is 32 bits (1 long)"
  - "Can overwrite running code - use caution"
  - "Useful for loading PASM code/data"
  - "Count must not exceed remaining registers"
