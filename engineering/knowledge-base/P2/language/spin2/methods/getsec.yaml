method: GETSEC
type: method
description: |
  Get seconds elapsed since system boot
category: Timing Operations
syntax: "seconds := GETSEC()"
parameters: []
returns:
  type: "long"
  description: "Seconds since boot (32-bit value)"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Display uptime in seconds
      debug("System uptime: ", udec(GETSEC()), " seconds")
    description: "Show system uptime"
  - code: |
      ' Long-running timer
      start_sec := GETSEC()
      ' ... much later ...
      elapsed_sec := GETSEC() - start_sec
      debug("Process ran for ", udec(elapsed_sec), " seconds")
    description: "Measure long durations"
  - code: |
      ' Periodic task every 10 seconds
      next_run := GETSEC() + 10
      repeat
        if GETSEC() >= next_run
          do_periodic_task()
          next_run += 10

notes:
  - "Based on system counter divided by clkfreq"
  - "32-bit value wraps after ~136 years"
  - "1-second resolution"
  - "Good for long-duration timing"
  - "More convenient than GETMS for human-readable times"
  - "Handles clock frequency changes automatically"
