method: AKPIN
type: method
description: |
  Acknowledge smart pin by clearing its IN flag
category: Smart Pin Operations
syntax: "AKPIN(PinField)"
parameters:
  - name: "PinField"
    type: "pin_field"
    description: "Pin number (0-63) or pin field expression"
returns:
  type: "void"
  description: "No return value"
examples:
  - code: |
      ' Acknowledge smart pin after processing
      value := RQPIN(16)  ' Read without acknowledge
      process(value)      ' Process the value
      AKPIN(16)          ' Now acknowledge
    description: "Separate read and acknowledge operations"
  - code: |
      ' Clear multiple smart pin flags
      repeat pin from 0 to 7
        AKPIN(pin)
    description: "Acknowledge multiple smart pins"
  - code: |
      ' Reset smart pin for next measurement
      if error_condition
        AKPIN(sensor_pin)  ' Clear flag to restart
    description: "Clear flag to reset measurement"
notes:
  - "Clears the smart pin's IN flag"
  - "Allows smart pin to begin next measurement/operation"
  - "Equivalent to the acknowledge part of RDPIN without reading"
  - "Useful when you've already read with RQPIN"
  - "Can acknowledge multiple pins using pin field ranges"
  - "Smart pin must be configured and have IN flag set"
timing:
