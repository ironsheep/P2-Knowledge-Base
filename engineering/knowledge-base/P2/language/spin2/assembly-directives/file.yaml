  binary file directly into Hub memory. The file path is relative to the

  source file location. This is useful for including images, fonts, lookup

  tables, or other pre-compiled binary data. The data is inserted byte-for-byte

  exactly as it appears in the file.

  Use ALIGNL or ALIGNW before FILE if specific alignment is needed for the data.
