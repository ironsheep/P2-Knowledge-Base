name: Timing and Delay Idioms
description: Common timing control patterns in Spin2
category: timing
frequency: very_high

idioms:
  - name: delay_milliseconds
    pattern: "waitms({ms})"
    description: Delay execution for specified milliseconds
    usage_count: 661
    examples:
      - "waitms(1)"
      - "waitms(10)"
      - "waitms(100)"
    context: Simple time delay, blocks execution

  - name: delay_microseconds
    pattern: "waitus({us})"
    description: Delay execution for specified microseconds
    usage_count: 82
    examples:
      - "waitus(1)"
      - "waitus(10)"
      - "waitus(100)"
    context: Fine-grained timing delay

  - name: wait_clock_ticks
    pattern: "waitct({target})"
    description: Wait until system counter reaches target
    usage_count: 87
    examples:
      - "waitct(t += (100 * MS_001))"
      - "waitct(0)"
      - "waitct(getct() + delay)"
    context: Precise timing based on system clock
