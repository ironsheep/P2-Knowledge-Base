operation_description: |
  Accumulates A-input trigger states within periods during measurement window of X+ clocks.
  Complementary to %10101 - provides duty measurement with time-windowed sampling.
  Measurement continues until X clocks elapse and current period completes.

x_parameter:
  usage: "Minimum measurement duration"
  bit_fields:
    - range: "X[31:0]"
      purpose: "Minimum clock cycles for measurement window"

y_parameter:
