operation_description: |
  Measures time across some number of A-rise/edge to B-rise/edge periods until X clocks
  elapse, then completes any period in progress. Provides oversampled period measurement
  with minimum duration constraint. Y[1:0] sets A/B sensitivity.

x_parameter:
  usage: "Minimum measurement duration"
  bit_fields:
    - range: "X[31:0]"
      purpose: "Minimum clock cycles for measurement"

y_parameter:
  usage: "Edge sensitivity"
  bit_fields:
    - range: "Y[1:0]"
      purpose: "Period edge detection sensitivity"

z_result:
  data_type: "Accumulated time measurement"
  bit_interpretation:
    - range: "Z[31:0]"
      meaning: "Total time within periods during measurement window"

common_applications:
  - application: "Time-windowed period measurement"
