operation_description: |
  Count A-highs mode with optional B-decrement provides level-based counting.
  Y[0] selects operation: Y[0]=0 counts A-input highs only, Y[0]=1 increments
  on A-input high and decrements on B-input high. X[31:0] sets measurement period
  (0=continuous). Useful for level-based rather than edge-based counting.

x_parameter:
  usage: "Measurement period"
  bit_fields:
    - range: "X[31:0]"
      purpose: "Period in clocks (0=continuous)"

y_parameter:
  usage: "Mode selection"
  bit_fields:
    - range: "Y[0]"
      purpose: "0=count A-highs, 1=A-inc/B-dec"

z_result:
  data_type: "32-bit count"
  bit_interpretation:
    - range: "Z[31:0]"
      meaning: "High level count or differential count"
