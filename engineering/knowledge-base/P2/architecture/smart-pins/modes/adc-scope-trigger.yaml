operation_description: |
  ADC scope with trigger mode provides oscilloscope-like functionality for capturing
  ADC data with triggering capability. Combines ADC sampling with trigger detection
  for synchronized data acquisition. Advanced mode requiring deep understanding of
  ADC operations and trigger configuration.
