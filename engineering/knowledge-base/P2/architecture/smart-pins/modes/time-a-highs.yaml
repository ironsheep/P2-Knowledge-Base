operation_description: |
  Time A-highs mode measures the duration of continuous high states on the A input.
  Upon each high-to-low transition, the previous high duration count is placed in Z
  and IN is raised. Z is limited to $80000000. Only high states are measured -
  low states are ignored. This provides selective pulse width measurement for
  positive pulses only.
