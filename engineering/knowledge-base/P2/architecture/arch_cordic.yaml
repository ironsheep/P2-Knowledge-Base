description: "32-bit pipelined CORDIC solver"
features:
    pipeline_depth: 55
    operations:
      - 32x32 unsigned multiply → 64-bit result
      - 64/32 unsigned divide → 32-bit quotient + remainder
      - 64-bit → 32-bit square root
      - Rotate (X,Y) by Theta
      - Polar to Cartesian conversion
      - Cartesian to Polar conversion
      - Unsigned to logarithm (32 → 5.27)
      - Logarithm to unsigned (5.27 → 32)
    timing:
      issue_rate: Every 8 clocks (8 cogs)
      result_latency: 55 clocks
      scale_correction: Automatic
