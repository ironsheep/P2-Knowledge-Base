## Instructions Clarified

### Flag Modification Instructions (Microcode-Level Control)
| Instruction | Function | Significance |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **MODC** | Modify C flag based on operand test | Microcode-level C flag control |
| **MODZ** | Modify Z flag based on operand test | Microcode-level Z flag control |
| **MODCZ** | Modify C and Z flags based on operand tests | Combined efficient flag control |

**Impact**: These expose processor microcode-level control for precise conditional execution setup.

### Arithmetic with Flag Control
| Instruction | Function | Significance |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **SUMC** | Sum with carry, modify C flag | Multi-precision arithmetic chains |
| **SUMNC** | Sum without carry, modify C flag | Selective carry control |
| **SUMZ** | Sum with zero handling, modify Z flag | Zero-detection arithmetic |
| **SUMNZ** | Sum ignoring zero, modify Z flag | Non-zero arithmetic chains |

**Impact**: Enable fine-grained arithmetic operations with custom flag behavior.

### Modulo Operations
| Instruction | Function | Significance |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **INCMOD** | Increment with modulo wraparound | Circular buffer indexing |
| **DECMOD** | Decrement with modulo wraparound | Reverse circular operations |

**Impact**: Atomic circular operations for efficient state machines and buffer management.

### Extended Precision Signed Arithmetic (CRITICAL PATTERN)
| Instruction | Function | Critical Role |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| **ADDSX** | Add with sign extension | **FINAL** instruction in multi-word signed addition |
| **SUBSX** | Subtract with sign extension | **FINAL** instruction in multi-word signed subtraction |
| **CMPSX** | Compare with sign extension | **FINAL** instruction in multi-word signed comparison |

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: The SX suffix instructions serve as terminal operations that convert carry/borrow chains to true mathematical sign indications.

### Fractional Arithmetic
| Instruction | Function | Significance |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **FRAC** | Fractional multiply (Spin2) | Fixed-point arithmetic in Spin2 |

**Impact**: Enables efficient scaling and proportional computations in high-level code.

## Programming Patterns Revealed

### 1. Microcode-Level Control Philosophy
**Pattern**: Direct flag manipulation using MODC/MODZ/MODCZ
**Significance**: P2 exposes processor microcode control to assembly programmers
**Enables**: Custom conditional execution patterns beyond traditional processors

### 2. Terminal Signed Multiword Pattern ⚡ CRITICAL
**Pattern**: Use ADDSX/SUBSX/CMPSX as FINAL instructions in signed multi-word chains
**Why Final**: Converts hardware carry/borrow to true mathematical sign
**Significance**: Enables correct extended precision signed arithmetic

### 3. ADD/SUB/CMP Family Suffix System
**Discovered Pattern**:
- **Base**: ADD, SUB, CMP (basic operations)
- **X Suffix**: ADDX, SUBX, CMPX (include carry/borrow, cumulative Z)
- **S Suffix**: ADDS, SUBS, CMPS (return true sign instead of carry/borrow)
- **SX Suffix**: ADDSX, SUBSX, CMPSX (both carry inclusion AND true sign)

### 4. Circular Operations
**Pattern**: INCMOD/DECMOD provide atomic circular buffer operations
**Significance**: Single-instruction state machine cycling and buffer management
