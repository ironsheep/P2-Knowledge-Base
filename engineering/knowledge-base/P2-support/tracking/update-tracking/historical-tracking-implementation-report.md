- **Issue resolution** example with timing ambiguity resolution
- **Cross-reference evolution** showing relationship development

**Demonstrates**:
- Real-world tracking complexity
- Source integration chronology
- Quality improvement patterns
- Complete traceability chain

### 3. History Browser Tool (`history-browser.py`)
**Interactive exploration tool** with comprehensive capabilities:
- **Entry evolution viewer**: Detailed version-by-version changes
- **Quality progression visualization**: Graphical completeness trends
- **Repository overview dashboard**: System-wide evolution metrics
- **Search and filtering**: Find entries by multiple criteria
- **Evolution report generation**: Comprehensive analysis reports

**Key Features**:
- Handles both enhanced and legacy tracking formats
- Interactive command-line interface
- Statistical analysis and visualization
- Export capabilities for reports
