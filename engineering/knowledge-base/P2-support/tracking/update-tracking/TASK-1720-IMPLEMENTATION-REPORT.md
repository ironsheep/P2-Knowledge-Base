# Task #1720 Implementation Report: Conflict Resolution System

**Completion Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Task**: Build the conflict resolution system for handling disagreements between sources  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Implementation Overview

Built a comprehensive 4-component conflict resolution system that automatically detects, resolves, tracks, and enables rollback of conflicts between P2 Knowledge Base sources.

## Components Delivered

### 1. Conflict Resolution Framework (`conflict-resolution-system.yaml`)
**Purpose**: Define systematic approach to handling source disagreements

**Key Features**:
- **4-Level Authority Hierarchy**: ABSOLUTE → SILICON_DOC_VERIFIED → DATASHEET_CONFIRMED → CSV_EXTRACTED
- **5 Conflict Types**: Direct contradictions, scope disagreements, precision mismatches, temporal inconsistencies, completeness gaps
- **5 Resolution Strategies**: Authority hierarchy, consensus building, precision synthesis, temporal precedence, completeness aggregation
- **Manual Escalation**: Complex cases requiring human review

**Authority Override Rules**:
```yaml
override_rules:
  absolute_override: "ABSOLUTE authority overrides all others unconditionally"
  chip_clarification: "Direct Chip Gracey statements take precedence"
  silicon_doc_primary: "Silicon doc preferred over datasheet for implementation details"
```

### 2. Automated Conflict Detection (`conflict-detector.py`)
**Purpose**: Systematically identify conflicts across knowledge base

**Capabilities**:
- **Direct Contradiction Detection**: Identifies opposing values for same field
- **Scope Disagreement Analysis**: Detects when sources cover different aspects
- **Precision Mismatch Identification**: Finds varying levels of detail
- **Severity Assessment**: Classifies conflicts as CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- **Batch Processing**: Analyzes entire knowledge base for conflicts

**Detection Algorithm**:
```python
def detect_direct_contradictions(self, entry_id: str, field_sources: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
    """Detect direct contradictions between sources"""
    conflicts = []
    for field, sources in field_sources.items():
        if self._values_conflict(value1, value2):
            severity = self._assess_conflict_severity(field, value1, value2)
```

### 3. Automated Conflict Resolution (`conflict-resolver.py`)
**Purpose**: Apply systematic resolution strategies to detected conflicts

**Resolution Methods**:
- **Authority Hierarchy**: Use highest-authority source automatically
- **Consensus Building**: Aggregate agreement across multiple sources
- **Precision Synthesis**: Combine different detail levels coherently
- **Manual Review Queue**: Escalate ambiguous cases to human reviewers
- **Confidence Scoring**: Rate resolution confidence (0.0-1.0)

**Resolution Pipeline**:
```python
def resolve_conflict(self, conflict: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Main resolution pipeline"""
    strategy = self._determine_resolution_strategy(conflict)
    resolution = self._apply_resolution_strategy(conflict, strategy)
    confidence = self._calculate_confidence_level(resolution)
```

### 4. Regeneration and Rollback System (`conflict-regenerator.py`)
**Purpose**: Enable re-evaluation and reversal of conflict decisions

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Conflict Snapshots**: Complete state capture before resolution
- **Regeneration Triggers**: Automatic detection of outdated resolutions
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Restore entries to pre-resolution state
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all resolution changes
- **Confidence Monitoring**: Track low-confidence resolutions for review

**Regeneration Triggers**:
- Low confidence resolutions (<0.7)
- Higher authority sources become available
- Manual review completions
- New source additions affecting past decisions

## Critical Insights Discovered

### 1. Authority Hierarchy Implementation
- **ABSOLUTE Level**: Chip Gracey clarifications override everything unconditionally
- **Silicon Doc Precedence**: Preferred over datasheet for implementation specifics
- **Datasheet Authority**: Takes precedence over CSV extractions
- **Source Attribution**: Every resolution tracks authority chain

### 2. Conflict Type Classification
- **Direct Contradictions**: Most common, easiest to resolve via authority
- **Scope Disagreements**: Require synthesis rather than selection
- **Precision Mismatches**: Enable hierarchical detail layering
- **Temporal Inconsistencies**: Resolve via recency with authority weighting
- **Completeness Gaps**: Aggregate information rather than choose

### 3. Resolution Strategy Selection
```yaml
strategy_selection_rules:
  direct_contradiction: "authority_hierarchy"
  scope_disagreement: "synthesis_combination" 
  precision_mismatch: "hierarchical_layering"
  temporal_inconsistency: "temporal_precedence_with_authority"
  completeness_gap: "completeness_aggregation"
```

## Integration Points

### With Existing Infrastructure
- **Builds on existing tracking schema** from Task #1719
- **Integrates with YAML source attribution** from Tasks #1715-1718
- **Uses authority levels** established in clarification system
- **Leverages Git integration** for atomic change tracking

### CLI Integration
```bash
# Detect conflicts across knowledge base
python conflict-detector.py scan-all

# Resolve specific conflict
python conflict-resolver.py resolve <conflict-id>

# Check for regeneration triggers
python conflict-regenerator.py check-triggers

# Roll back problematic resolution
python conflict-regenerator.py rollback <conflict-id>
```

## Quality Assurance Features

### 1. Confidence Scoring
- Every resolution receives confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- Low confidence (<0.7) triggers automatic regeneration consideration
- Manual review required for confidence <0.5

### 2. Complete Audit Trail
- Pre-resolution snapshots captured automatically
- All resolution decisions logged with timestamps
- Rollback capability with full state restoration
- Change history preserved in Git integration

### 3. Validation Framework
- Resolution results validated against known patterns
- Authority hierarchy violations prevented automatically
- Circular reference detection and prevention
- Data integrity checks on resolution application
