use_cases:
  primary:
    - "Text and graphic display applications"
    - "Educational demonstrations of Charlieplexing"
    - "Status indicators and visual feedback"
    - "Simple scrolling message displays"
  secondary:
    - "Game displays and scoring"
    - "Data visualization"
    - "Clock and timer displays"
    - "Interactive learning projects"
    
advantages:
  - "56 LEDs controlled with only 8 pins"
  - "Efficient Charlieplexing implementation"
  - "Low total current consumption (4mA)"
  - "Excellent educational value for multiplexing concepts"
  - "Fast P2 switching enables flicker-free operation"
  - "Suitable for text and simple graphics"
  
limitations:
  - "Only one LED can be lit at a time (requires multiplexing)"
  - "Requires continuous refresh for multiple LED display"
  - "Green LEDs only (not full color)"
  - "Limited to 8×7 resolution"
  - "Programming complexity higher than direct control"
  
programming_concepts:
  charlieplexing_control:
    method: "Set one pin HIGH, one pin LOW, others INPUT"
    example: "To light Row 3 Col 6: P3=HIGH, P0=LOW, others=INPUT"
    turn_off: "Set both control pins to INPUT mode"
    
  multiplexing_strategy:
    refresh_rate: "Minimum 50Hz for flicker-free operation"
    timing: "Switch between LEDs faster than eye can detect"
    persistence: "Human eye integrates rapid switching"
    
  programming_examples: |
    ' Light single LED at Row 3, Col 6
    DIRL P0    ' Set P0 as output LOW
    DIRH P3    ' Set P3 as output HIGH
    ' Other pins remain as INPUT
    
    ' Turn off LED
    DIRNOT P0  ' Set P0 as input
    DIRNOT P3  ' Set P3 as input
