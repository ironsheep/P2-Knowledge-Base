validation_conclusion: |
  The PASM2 instruction YAML schema successfully handles all instruction types 
  and complexity levels found in the P2 instruction set. The representative 
  samples demonstrate comprehensive coverage of required information while 
  providing practical value for developers. The schema is ready for full-scale 
  automated extraction of the complete ~450 instruction set.
  
  Key strengths include flexible timing models, detailed operand specifications, 
  practical code examples, and comprehensive cross-referencing capability. 
  The structure supports the planned 4-layer aggregation approach and provides 
  a solid foundation for the P2 knowledge base.

next_steps:
  1: "Create automated extraction system"
  2: "Process complete instruction set (~440 remaining)"  
  3: "Generate instruction index and coverage report"
  4: "Validate cross-references and relationships"
  5: "Complete Task #1716 with comprehensive PASM2 coverage"
