# Chapter 1: Testing Template Fixes

*Let's verify all three problems are solved*

## The Hook: Immediate Test

Here's a simple PASM2 code example to start:

```pasm2
        mov     x, #42          ' Load initial value
        add     x, #1           ' Increment
        waitx   ##25_000_000    ' Wait 0.25 seconds
```

Look at that - we have code with syntax highlighting!

## What Just Happened?

We loaded a value, incremented it, and waited. Simple but effective.

:::sidetrack
**Philosophy Note**: Sometimes the simplest tests reveal the biggest problems. If this sidetrack box doesn't have a gray background with dashed border, we know the Lua filter isn't working.
:::

## Core Concept: Checking Headers

Look at the page header at the top of this page. It should say "Chapter 1: Testing Template Fixes" not "Contents". This is critical for reader orientation.

:::yourturn
**Your Turn:** Check these three things right now:

1. Did this chapter start on a new page after the TOC?
2. Does the header show the chapter name?
3. Is the section numbering normal (not 0.4)?

If all three are YES, our fixes worked!
:::

## Common Gotchas

If the PDF generation fails, check:
- Is the template at `/workspace/templates/p2kb-pasm-desilva-enhanced.latex`?
- Is the Lua filter at `/workspace/filters/desilva-boxes.lua`?
- Is XeLaTeX available?

:::missing
üöß **CONTENT MISSING - COMING SOON**

This section would contain advanced CORDIC operations and timing calculations. This box should have a violet background with thick border.
:::

## What We've Learned

- ‚úÖ Chapters should start on new pages
- ‚úÖ Headers should show chapter names
- ‚úÖ Numbering should be correct

**Have Fun!** If you can read this, the PDF generated successfully!

# Chapter 2: Second Chapter Test

This chapter MUST start on a new page. If it's on the same page as Chapter 1, the `\clearpage` fix didn't work.

## Header Check

The page header should now say "Chapter 2: Second Chapter Test" not "Chapter 1" and definitely not "Contents".

:::review
üîç **NEEDS TECHNICAL REVIEW**

This is a review box. It should have an orange background with thick border. We use these to mark content that needs verification.
:::

## Testing Mathematics

Here's an equation to test math rendering:

The wait time in seconds is: $t = \frac{cycles}{frequency}$

For our P2 at 200MHz: $t = \frac{25,000,000}{200,000,000} = 0.125$ seconds

:::diagram
üé® **DIAGRAM NEEDED**

A timing diagram would go here showing clock cycles and wait periods. This box should have a blue background.
:::

## Code Block Test

```pasm2
loop    drvh    #56             ' LED on
        waitx   ##25_000_000    ' Wait 0.25 seconds
        drvl    #56             ' LED off
        waitx   ##25_000_000    ' Wait 0.25 seconds
        jmp     #loop           ' Repeat forever
```

:::interlude
This is an interlude - a gentle aside that doesn't interrupt the flow. It should have a gray background with no border, just a title.

:::chapterend
**Congratulations!** You've completed the template test.

You've verified:
- Chapter pagination works
- Headers update correctly
- Numbering is fixed

**Next:** Use this template with your actual De Silva manual content!

# Chapter 3: Final Verification

If you're reading this on a new page with "Chapter 3: Final Verification" in the header, everything is working perfectly!

## The Three Fixes Confirmed

1. **Chapter Pages**: Each chapter started on a new page ‚úÖ
2. **Headers**: Each page header showed the correct chapter name ‚úÖ
3. **Numbering**: Sections aren't numbered 0.4 or other weirdness ‚úÖ

## Ready for Production

This template is now ready for your actual De Silva manual content. The fixes are built into the template itself, so they'll work with any markdown content you provide.
