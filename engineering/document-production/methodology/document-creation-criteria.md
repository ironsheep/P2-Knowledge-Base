# Document Creation Decision Criteria

## Philosophy: Purposeful, Not Avoidant

**Goal**: Higher gate for new documents, not prevention  
**Principle**: Work harder to justify, but create when truly needed  
**Test**: Is this genuinely new content type that serves a distinct purpose?

---

## Create New Document When:

### **1. Distinct Content Type**
- **Content serves fundamentally different purpose** from existing docs
- **Different audience** (process vs deliverable vs reference)
- **Different lifecycle** (living vs archival vs template)

**Example**: Sprint retrospective template vs PROJECT-MASTER current state
- Different purpose: template vs status
- Different lifecycle: reusable vs evolving

### **2. High-Value Separation**  
- **Frequently referenced independently** from other content
- **Shared across multiple contexts** (multiple sprints, team members)
- **Reduces cognitive load** when focused on specific task

**Example**: MCP template vs individual sprint MCP
- Template: reusable across sprints
- Individual MCP: specific to one execution

### **3. Size/Complexity Threshold**
- **Content would overwhelm** a consolidated document
- **Different maintenance cadence** (updated at different rates)
- **Search/navigation improved** by separation

**Example**: Detailed audit procedures vs high-level project overview

### **4. Risk Mitigation**
- **Editing conflicts** if consolidated (multiple people updating)
- **Version control clarity** (track changes to specific content type)
- **Backup/recovery** benefits from separation

---

## Consolidate/Merge When:

### **1. Content Overlap**
- **Saying similar things** in different documents
- **Cross-references dominate** the content
- **Maintenance burden** of keeping synchronized

### **2. Low Individual Value**
- **Rarely referenced independently**
- **Makes more sense in context** of larger document
- **Too small** to justify separate navigation

### **3. Temporal Relationship**
- **Sequential workflow** where documents are always used together
- **Same decision-making context**
- **Same update frequency**

---

## Decision Process

### **Before Creating New Document:**

1. **Purpose Test**: What specific purpose does this serve that existing docs don't?
2. **Audience Test**: Who will use this and how is that different from existing docs?
3. **Lifecycle Test**: How often updated? When referenced? How maintained?
4. **Value Test**: Does separation create more value than consolidation cost?

### **Consolidation Triggers:**

1. **Redundancy Check**: Are we saying the same things multiple places?
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Are we struggling to keep related docs synchronized?
3. **Navigation Confusion**: Are people having trouble finding the right document?
4. **Size Check**: Have documents become too small to justify separate existence?

## Current Document Architecture Assessment

### **Existing Documents - Justified:**

#### **engineering/operations/README.md** (was PROJECT-MASTER.md)
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for current project state
- **Audience**: Anyone needing to understand "where we are now"  
- **Lifecycle**: Living document, frequently updated
- **Value**: Essential orientation document

#### **Document Creation Criteria** (this document)
- **Purpose**: Decision framework for document architecture
- **Audience**: Document creators (us) when facing create/consolidate decisions
- **Lifecycle**: Template/reference, infrequently updated
- **Value**: Prevents ad-hoc decision making

#### **MCP Templates**
- **Purpose**: Reusable structure for detailed task planning
- **Audience**: Sprint planners creating detailed execution plans
- **Lifecycle**: Template, stable but evolving based on experience
- **Value**: Consistency and completeness in sprint execution

### **Recently Created - Assessment:**

#### **project-information-architecture.md**
- **Purpose**: Archive organization strategy
- **Justification**: New content type (information architecture) not covered elsewhere
- **Value**: Prevents loss of sprint learning, enables process improvement
- **Verdict**: âœ… Justified - distinct content type serving archive/recovery needs

## Guidelines for Sprint Document Creation

### **Each Sprint May Need:**
- **Planning Documents**: Question exhaustion process (temporary, archived)
- **MCPs**: Detailed execution plans (temporary, archived)  
- **Execution Artifacts**: Work outputs (permanent deliverables)
- **Should-Have-Considered**: Mid-sprint insights (temporary, archived)
- **Retrospective**: Process improvements (archived, but informs future)

### **Document Creation Pattern:**
1. **Start with existing templates** where possible
2. **Justify new documents** using criteria above
3. **Name purposefully** (clear what it is and why separate)
4. **Plan lifecycle** (temporary vs permanent vs archived)

---

## Success Metrics

### **Good Document Architecture:**
- **Coffee-deprived recovery test**: Can quickly orient after time away
- **Minimal hunting**: Find needed information quickly  
- **Clear purposes**: Each document has distinct value
- **Low maintenance**: Documents don't fight each other

### **Warning Signs:**
- **Saying same things** in multiple places
- **Frequent cross-references** instead of consolidated content
- **Confusion about where to put new information**
- **Documents that are never referenced independently**

---

**Decision Rule**: When in doubt, **err toward creation** with clear justification rather than **forced consolidation** that loses value.
