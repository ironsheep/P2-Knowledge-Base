### Why These Files Are Protected

1. **Expensive AI Generation**: Created using Opus 4.1, the most capable (and costly) AI model
2. **Cannot Be Perfectly Regenerated**: Each AI generation produces unique results
3. **Master Sources**: These are the definitive sources for the Green Book Tutorial
4. **Historical Record**: Preserves the exact output from the original generation sessions
5. **Production Quality**: Both validated and ready for immediate use

### Working Copy Process

**NEVER modify these files directly!**

To make changes:
1. Copy to workspace: 
   ```bash
   # Use v4 as the most complete version
   cp P2-Smart-Pins-Green-Book-Tutorial-v4.md /engineering/pdf-forge/production/smart-pins-manual/
   ```
2. Work on the copy in workspace
3. These masters remain unchanged as reference

### Semantic Gap Types Present

Both documents contain 7 types of content markers:
- `needs-diagram` - Visual diagrams needed (addressed in enhanced version)
- `needs-code-review` - Code samples need review
- `needs-technical-review` - Technical accuracy verification
- `preliminary-content` - Content is draft/beta
- `needs-examples` - More examples needed
- `needs-verification` - Hardware verification needed
- `tip` - Helpful tips and notes

### Image References (Enhanced Version)

The enhanced version references these key images:
- `assets/smart-pins-master-trimmed.png` - Master architecture
- `assets/P2 SmartPins-220809_page*.png` - Mode-specific diagrams
- All images properly placed AFTER text introduction, never before headings

### Git Preservation

Both files are committed to Git for permanent preservation:
- Original Text-Only - Commit: d0616d6

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REMINDER**: Both files have read-only permissions (444). Any attempt to modify will fail. This is intentional and must be maintained.

‚úÖ **VALIDATED**: Both versions have been reviewed and validated as complete, accurate, and production-ready.

üéØ **PRIMARY USE**: Version 4 (Complete I/O Tutorial) should be used for PDF generation as it provides the most comprehensive coverage of P2 I/O capabilities.
