### Working Copy Process

**NEVER modify these files directly!**

To make changes:
1. Copy to workspace: 
   ```bash
   # Use v4 as the most complete version
   cp P2-Smart-Pins-Green-Book-Tutorial-v4.md /engineering/pdf-forge/production/smart-pins-manual/
   ```
2. Work on the copy in workspace
3. These masters remain unchanged as reference

### Semantic Gap Types Present

Both documents contain 7 types of content markers:
- `needs-diagram` - Visual diagrams needed (addressed in enhanced version)
- `needs-code-review` - Code samples need review
- `needs-technical-review` - Technical accuracy verification
- `preliminary-content` - Content is draft/beta
- `needs-examples` - More examples needed
- `needs-verification` - Hardware verification needed
- `tip` - Helpful tips and notes

### Image References (Enhanced Version)

The enhanced version references these key images:
- `assets/smart-pins-master-trimmed.png` - Master architecture
- `assets/P2 SmartPins-220809_page*.png` - Mode-specific diagrams
- All images properly placed AFTER text introduction, never before headings

### Git Preservation

Both files are committed to Git for permanent preservation:
- Original Text-Only - Commit: d0616d6
- Enhanced With Images - Commit: 33de948

### Emergency Recovery

If either file is accidentally modified:

**For Text-Only Version:**
```bash
git checkout d0616d6 -- P2-Smart-Pins-Green-Book-Tutorial.md
chmod 444 P2-Smart-Pins-Green-Book-Tutorial.md
```

**For Enhanced Version:**
```bash
git log --oneline P2-Smart-Pins-Green-Book-Tutorial-With-Images.md

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REMINDER**: Both files have read-only permissions (444). Any attempt to modify will fail. This is intentional and must be maintained.

‚úÖ **VALIDATED**: Both versions have been reviewed and validated as complete, accurate, and production-ready.

üéØ **PRIMARY USE**: Version 4 (Complete I/O Tutorial) should be used for PDF generation as it provides the most comprehensive coverage of P2 I/O capabilities.
