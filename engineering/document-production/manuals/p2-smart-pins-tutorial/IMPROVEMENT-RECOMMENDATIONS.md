## üñºÔ∏è Critical Image Gaps (Priority 1)

### Modes NEEDING Visual Documentation
These modes would significantly benefit from diagrams to clarify complex concepts:

#### **High Priority - Complex Timing Modes**
1. **Pulse/Cycle Output (%00100)** 
   - Need: Timing diagram showing pulse generation patterns
   - Why: Visual timing relationships critical for understanding

2. **NCO Duty (%00110)**
   - Need: Duty cycle waveform illustration
   - Why: Shows relationship between X and Y parameters visually

3. **Periodic Pulse/SMPS (%01010)**
   - Need: SMPS waveform with duty cycle variations
   - Why: Critical for power supply applications

#### **Medium Priority - Encoder/Measurement Modes**
4. **A-B Encoder (%01101)**
   - Need: Phase relationship diagram between A and B signals
   - Why: Visual phase difference crucial for encoder understanding

5. **Incremental Encoder (%01110)**
   - Need: Pulse train illustration with direction changes
   - Why: Shows count accumulation patterns

6. **Comparator Mode (%01111)**
   - Need: Threshold and hysteresis visualization
   - Why: Analog behavior needs visual representation

#### **Lower Priority - Accumulation Modes**
7. **Time Accumulation (%10000-%10011)**
   - Need: Accumulation over time graph
   - Why: Shows integration concept visually

8. **Pin State Measurement (%11010)**
   - Need: State transition timing diagram
   - Why: Clarifies measurement windows

**Current Coverage**: 14 of 32 modes have images (44%)  
**Target Coverage**: 22 of 32 modes (69%) for v1.1  
**Ideal Coverage**: 26 of 32 modes (80%+) for v2.0

## üìù Code Example Improvements

### Non-Testable Code Classification

**Current State**: Some code fragments are intentionally partial for clarity

**Three Categories of Code**:
1. **Complete Programs** (100% testable) - Full Spin2/PASM2 programs
2. **Code Fragments** (not testable) - Instructional snippets
3. **Pseudo-code** (not testable) - Conceptual demonstrations

### Recommended Example Additions

#### **Multi-Pin Synchronization**
```spin2
' NEEDED: Complete 8-channel synchronized PWM example
' Shows phase-locked startup and dynamic duty adjustment
' Currently only have simple 2-pin examples
```

#### **Error Recovery Patterns**
```spin2
' NEEDED: Smart Pin error detection and recovery
' Shows timeout handling, overflow detection, reset sequences
' Currently missing robust error handling examples
```

#### **Inter-COG Coordination**
```spin2
' NEEDED: Multiple COGs sharing Smart Pin access
' Shows arbitration, data handoff, synchronized sampling
' Currently limited to single-COG examples
```

#### **Production Applications**
```spin2
' NEEDED: Complete motor controller with encoder feedback
' NEEDED: Multi-channel data acquisition system
' NEEDED: USB device implementation example
' Currently mostly demonstration code, not production patterns
```
