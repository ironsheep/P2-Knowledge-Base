## To deSilva

*Whose legendary P1 assembly tutorial taught a generation of programmers that assembly language could be approachable, enjoyable, and even fun. Your unique voice—combining technical precision with human warmth—showed us that great documentation teaches not just the mind, but speaks to the spirit of discovery.*
