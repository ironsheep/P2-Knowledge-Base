# Acknowledgments

This manual stands on the shoulders of giants. We gratefully acknowledge:

## Primary Contributors

**deSilva** - For creating the gold standard of microcontroller documentation with the P1 Assembly Tutorial. Your pedagogical approach, combining technical depth with human empathy, remains unmatched. This manual attempts to honor your legacy while adapting to the P2's capabilities.

**Iron Sheep Productions LLC (Stephen M Moraco)** - For extensive P2 documentation efforts, community tools, and the vision of creating an AI-optimized knowledge base. Your systematic approach to extracting and organizing P2 knowledge made this comprehensive manual possible.

**Chip Gracey** - Creator of the Propeller architecture. Thank you for giving us a microcontroller that thinks differently and challenges us to do the same.

## Community Contributors

**The Parallax Forums Community** - Your questions, answers, code examples, and endless experimentation have created a living knowledge base that no single author could match.

**Early P2 Adopters** - Who dealt with evolving documentation, changing specifications, and still produced amazing projects that showed us what was possible.

## Technical Reviewers

Special thanks to those who reviewed drafts, tested code examples, and provided invaluable feedback:
- The P2 Documentation Team at Parallax
- Community members who beta-tested examples
- Everyone who reported errors and suggested improvements

## Inspiration

**The MIT AI Lab** - For showing us that technical documentation can have personality

**Donald Knuth** - For proving that programming texts can be literature

**The Demoscene Community** - For pushing hardware beyond its limits and inspiring us to do the same

## Production Notes

This manual was created using:
- Knowledge extracted from P2 documentation, forum discussions, and code examples
- AI-assisted content generation trained on deSilva's writing style
- Community validation and real-world testing
- A commitment to making parallel processing accessible to everyone
