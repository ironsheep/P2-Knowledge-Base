# P2 PASM De Silva Style - Creation Guide

## üéØ Document Purpose
Creating a pedagogical PASM2 manual that captures deSilva's teaching philosophy: approachable, hands-on, and genuinely enjoyable assembly language learning.

## üßó Technical Climbing Methodology Applied

This document follows the project-wide Technical Climbing Methodology, contributing to all four P2KB facets:

1. **Rich Trusted Source** - Each iteration incorporates newly validated P2 information
2. **Download-on-Demand** - Optimized for Claude instances helping P2 developers
3. **Human Documentation** - Pedagogically sound manuals for learning
4. **AI-Ingestible Format** - Structure supports future JSON schema extraction

### Regeneration Cycles: Our Climbing Strategy

**Why We Regenerate:**

- Community feedback identifies gaps
- Pedagogical improvements discovered
- Technical corrections needed

**Protection Points (What We Preserve):**
- Successful pedagogical patterns Opus created
- Voice and tone that resonates
- Code examples that work
- Structure that flows

**Climbing Higher (What Improves):**
- Generation N: Base content with available sources
- Generation N+1: Enhanced with new trusted sources + process improvements
- Generation N+2: Refined with community feedback + proven patterns
- Result: Monotonic quality improvement

**Documentation as Protection:**
- Every success ‚Üí Documented in this guide
- Every gap ‚Üí Captured in technical-debt.md
- Every iteration ‚Üí Builds on protected foundation
- No regression possible ‚Üí Previous quality is our safety floor

# PART 1: CONTENT CREATION (What Authors Write)

## üìù Content Philosophy

### The deSilva Voice (Document-Specific)

**Note**: This voice is specific to pedagogical manuals. Technical references will have different voice requirements.

**Voice Consistency Rule**: Every regeneration of THIS document must maintain THIS voice.

- **Conversational**: "Well, here we are! You're about to embark..."
- **Encouraging**: "Don't worry, we'll get through this together"
- **Honest**: "This is complex, but here's the medicine cabinet"
- **Playful**: "Uff!" when completing something hard
- **Human**: Acknowledge frustration, celebrate victories

### Progressive Learning Structure

**Pedagogical Foundation**: Constructivist Learning Theory (Piaget, Vygotsky)
- Learners build knowledge on existing foundations
- New knowledge must connect to prior understanding
- Active engagement creates deeper learning than passive reception

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. **Hook**: Start with working code
   - *Theory*: Experiential Learning (Kolb, 1984) - Concrete experience before abstract conceptualization
   - *Template*: 3-5 lines of immediately runnable code with visible result
   
2. **Explore**: Understand what just happened
   - *Theory*: Inquiry-Based Learning - Discovery after experience leads to retention
   - *Template*: "Let's see what each line actually did..."
   
3. **Expand**: Add complexity gradually
   - *Theory*: Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky) - Stay within reach of current ability
   - *Template*: Add ONE new element, keeping 80% familiar
   
4. **Practice**: "Your Turn" exercises
   - *Theory*: Active Learning - Doing > Watching > Reading > Listening
   - *Template*: Modify working code before creating from scratch
   
5. **Medicine**: Simpler alternatives when overwhelmed
   - *Theory*: Cognitive Load Theory - Provide escape route when working memory saturates
   - *Template*: "Feeling overwhelmed? Here's the 3-line version that just works..."

## üìö Content Requirements

### Chapter Structure Template

**Pedagogical Foundation**: Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction (Gagne, 1985)
- Gain attention ‚Üí Inform objectives ‚Üí Recall prior learning ‚Üí Present content ‚Üí Provide guidance ‚Üí Elicit performance ‚Üí Provide feedback ‚Üí Assess ‚Üí Enhance retention

**How This Template Embodies The Theory**:

```markdown
# Chapter N: Catchy Title

*Italicized tagline that captures the essence*

## The Hook: Immediate Engagement
[Theory: Gain Attention - Create curiosity gap]
Start with working code that does something surprising/useful in 3-5 lines
"Look at this - just three instructions and your LED is blinking!"

## What Just Happened?
[Theory: Inform Objectives - Set expectations]
"By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to..."
Break down the hook code line by line

## Core Concept 1
[Theory: Present New Content + Recall Prior Learning]
Connect to previous chapter: "Remember how we..."
Introduce ONE new idea building on that foundation
Show code example with ONE thing changed

## The Medicine Cabinet
[Theory: Provide Learning Guidance - Scaffold for different levels]
"If that's too much, here's the absolute minimum:"
Provide simpler alternative that still works

## Your Turn: Experiments
[Theory: Elicit Performance - Active practice]

### Experiment 1: Simple Modification
Change ONE thing from the example
Success is immediately visible

## Common Gotchas
[Theory: Provide Feedback - Address misconceptions]
"If your LED isn't blinking, check..."
Each gotcha has a clear fix

## What We've Learned
[Theory: Assess Performance - Self-check understanding]
- ‚úÖ Concrete achievement they can demonstrate
- ‚úÖ Skill they can now apply

## Coming Up Next
[Theory: Enhance Retention and Transfer]
"Now that you can X, we'll use it to build Y..."

---

**Have Fun!** [Emotional engagement improves retention]

```

### Special Content Sections

#### Section Numbering Conventions

**CRITICAL**: Maintain consistent numbering/lettering throughout the manual:

- **Chapters**: Numbered 1, 2, 3... (standard chapter numbering)
- **Sidetracks**: Lettered A, B, C, D, E, F... across the entire manual
  - Example: "Sidetrack A: Why Start at Address 0?"
  - Example: "Sidetrack B: The Philosophy of Parallel Processing"
- **Interludes**: Numbered 1, 2, 3... across the entire manual
  - Example: "Interlude 1: A Brief History of the Propeller"
  - Example: "Interlude 2: What Makes P2 Different"

**Implementation Notes**:
- Track sidetrack letters globally (not per chapter)
- Track interlude numbers globally (not per chapter)
- Add letter/number to the title within the content
- Template will style appropriately

#### Missing Content Placeholder
```markdown
:::missing
üöß **CONTENT MISSING - COMING SOON**

This section will cover [specific topic]...
[Expected content: instruction tables, timing diagrams, etc.]
:::
```

#### Technical Review Needed
```markdown
:::review
üîç **NEEDS TECHNICAL REVIEW**

[Specific claim needing verification]
Source: [where this came from]
Question: [what needs checking]
:::
```

#### Diagram Placeholder
```markdown
:::diagram
üé® **DIAGRAM NEEDED**

[Description of diagram: e.g., "8-COG hub access timing"]
Key elements to show:
- Element 1
- Element 2
:::
```

#### Your Turn Exercise

**Pedagogical Foundation**: Scaffolded Practice (Wood, Bruner, Ross, 1976)
- Start with high support, gradually remove scaffolding
- Success builds confidence for next challenge
- Clear success criteria prevents frustration

```markdown
:::yourturn
**Your Turn:** [Action verb + specific task]

Starting code:
```pasm2
        mov     x, #0  ' [What this gives them]
```

Goal: [Observable outcome - "Make the LED blink twice as fast"]
Hint: [One specific thing to focus on - "Which line controls timing?"]
Success Check: [How they know it worked - "LED toggles every 0.125 seconds"]
:::
```

#### Chapter Conclusion
```markdown
:::chapterend
**Congratulations!** [Specific achievement]

You now understand:
- Key concept 1
- Key concept 2

**Next:** [Preview of next chapter]
:::
```

## üìñ Code Example Design Principles

**Pedagogical Foundation**: Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)
- Working memory capacity is limited (7¬±2 items)
- Intrinsic load (complexity) + Extraneous load (presentation) must not exceed capacity
- Examples should minimize extraneous load to maximize learning

### The "First Exposure" Pattern

**Theory Applied**: One new element at a time
```pasm2
' GOOD: Introducing ADD (only instruction is new)
        add     x, #1         ' Everything else familiar
        
' BAD: Introducing ADD (too many new things)
        add     value, delta wc  ' New instruction, new registers, new flag
```

### Code Example Naming Convention

**Decision**: Use semantic naming, NOT numerical sequencing

**Rationale** (differs from original deSilva college course approach):
- **Our Context**: AI knowledge base + reference manual, not linear course
- **Access Pattern**: Non-linear, search-based, jump-to-what-you-need
- **AI Optimization**: Semantic names provide context for LLM understanding
- **Maintainability**: Adding examples doesn't cascade numbering changes
- **Modern Practice**: Aligns with MDN, React docs, etc.

**Two Types of Code Display**:

1. **Complete Program Blocks** (full working examples):
   - Start with descriptive comment: `' LED Blinker - Basic`
   - Semantic naming throughout
   - These are complete, runnable programs
   
2. **Code Snippets** (1-2 lines discussed inline):
   - No header needed
   - Still use code highlighting
   - For discussing specific instructions or concepts

**Example of Named Program Block**:
```pasm2
' LED Blinker - Your first PASM2 program!
        org     0
        drvh    #56
        waitx   ##25_000_000
        drvl    #56
        waitx   ##25_000_000
        jmp     #$-4
```

**Example of Inline Snippet**:
```pasm2
        add     x, #1    ' Just showing this instruction
```

**Naming Pattern Guidelines**:
- Format: `' [Function] - [Variant/Detail]`
- Examples:
  - `' LED Blinker - Basic`
  - `' LED Blinker - With Register`
  - `' LED Pattern - SOS`
  - `' PWM Fader - Triangle Wave`
  - `' Multi-COG Example - Synchronized LEDs`

**Why This Matters for P2KB**:
- Searchable by concept ("Find all PWM examples")
- Self-documenting for future maintainers
- Claude/GPT can understand intent from name
- Readers can skip to relevant examples

### The "Complete Concept" Principle

**Pedagogical Foundation**: Functional Completeness
- Every example must complete the path from idea ‚Üí concept ‚Üí working code
- No broken examples that "would work if..."
- Simplification must never break functionality

**Example**:
```pasm2
' GOOD: Simple but complete
        drvh    #56         ' LED on - works immediately

' BAD: Simple but incomplete
        add     x, #1       ' What's x? Where's initialization? What happens next?
```

### The "Progression" Pattern

**Theory Applied**: Zone of Proximal Development - Each step within reach
```markdown
Step 1: Simplest form
        add     x, #1

Step 2: Add one variation  
        add     x, y

Step 3: Add one feature
        add     x, y wc
```

### The "Success Visibility" Pattern

**Theory Applied**: Immediate feedback improves learning
```pasm2
' GOOD: Result immediately visible
        drvh    #56          ' LED turns on - you can see it!

' BAD: Result hidden in register
        mov     x, #42       ' What happened? Can't tell without debugger
```

## üíä The Medicine Cabinet Pattern

**Pedagogical Foundation**: Differentiated Instruction (Tomlinson, 1999)
- Learners have different readiness levels
- Provide multiple paths to understanding
- Not "dumbing down" but "different door in"

### Types of Medicine

**Type 1: Minimum Viable Version**
```markdown
Feeling overwhelmed by CORDIC calculations?
Medicine: Just use MUL for now - it's good enough for most cases
```

**Type 2: Concrete Analogy**
```markdown
COGs seem confusing?
Medicine: Think of it like 8 people in a kitchen, each with their own cutting board
```

**Type 3: Just Make It Work**
```markdown
Timing calculations hurting your brain?
Medicine: Use ##25_000_000 for 0.25 seconds at 100MHz. Always works.
```

**When to Provide Medicine**:
- After introducing complex concept
- When multiple approaches exist
- Before learner frustration point (not after!)

## üö´ Content DON'Ts

### NEVER Include Style Information
‚ùå "This should be in a gray box"
‚ùå "Make this text yellow"
‚ùå "Use dashed border here"
‚úÖ Just write the content - template handles appearance

### NEVER Use LaTeX Commands
‚ùå `\textbf{important}`
‚ùå `\begin{sidetrack}`
‚ùå `\section{Title}`
‚úÖ Use markdown: `**important**`, `:::sidetrack`, `## Title`

### NEVER Escape Special Characters
‚ùå `2\^9` 
‚ùå `\#define`
‚ùå `\_underscore`
‚úÖ Write naturally: `2^9`, `#define`, `_underscore`

### NEVER Duplicate Box Titles
‚ùå 
```markdown
:::sidetrack
### Sidetrack: Philosophy
```
‚úÖ 
```markdown
:::sidetrack
Philosophy content directly...
```

# PART 2: STYLE IMPLEMENTATION (What Template Does)

## üîÑ Template Evolution Protocol

**Reality**: Style requirements emerge DURING document production, not before.

### The Discovery Cycle

**Part 1 Generation:**
1. Generate content with known patterns
2. **Discover** new style need (e.g., "warning box")
3. **Mark** with generic pattern: `:::warning`
4. **Continue** generating (don't stop for style)

**Template Update:**
1. **Collect** all new patterns from Part 1
2. **Design** style for each pattern
3. **Update** template with new styles
4. **Document** in this guide

**Part 2+ Generation:**
1. Use expanded pattern set
2. Discover fewer new patterns
3. By Part 3-4, discovery usually stops
4. Template stabilizes

### Style Discovery Workflow

```markdown
CONTENT CREATION:
1. Need new visual element
2. Create semantic marker (:::newtype)
3. Document what it should convey
4. Keep writing

TEMPLATE ENHANCEMENT:
1. Find all :::newtype instances
2. Design appropriate style
3. Add to template
4. Update this guide

REGENERATION:
1. New patterns available
2. Consistent styling throughout
3. No manual style fixes needed
```

### Pattern Maturity Levels

- **Part 1**: 60-70% of patterns discovered
- **Part 2**: 85-90% of patterns discovered  
- **Part 3**: 95-99% of patterns discovered
- **Part 4+**: Template essentially complete

### Key Principle

**DON'T let style block content generation!**
- Mark semantically
- Style later
- Keep momentum

## üé® Visual Style Rules (AUTOMATIC)

### Color Scheme
- **Yellow**: Code blocks (listings)
- **Gray**: Sidetracks and interludes
- **Violet**: Missing content warnings
- **Orange**: Technical review needs
- **Blue**: Diagram placeholders
- **Green**: Chapter endings
- **Bold only**: Inline code (no background)

### Box Styles (AUTOMATIC)
| Box Type | Background | Border | Title |
|----------|------------|--------|-------|
| `:::sidetrack` | Light gray | Dotted | "Sidetrack [Letter]:" prefix |
| `:::interlude` | Gray | None | "Interlude [Number]:" prefix |
| `:::missing` | Violet | Thick | Auto-generated |
| `:::review` | Orange | Thick | Auto-generated |
| `:::diagram` | Blue | Normal | Auto-generated |
| `:::yourturn` | Yellow tint | Normal | No prefix |
| `:::chapterend` | Green | Normal | With separator |

### Typography (AUTOMATIC)
- Chapter numbers: Large, bold
- Section headers: Progressive sizing
- Inline code: Bold (via `\texttt{\textbf{}}`)
- Code blocks: Monospace on yellow
- Emphasis: Italic for taglines

## üîß Technical Processing

### File Workflow
```
1. AUTHOR writes: Part1-WORKING.md (with markers, notes)
   ‚Üì
2. CLEAN via: uppercase-instructions-latex.py
   ‚Üì
3. RESULT: Part1-READY.md (clean, no markers)
   ‚Üì
4. ESCAPE via: latex-escape-all.sh
   ‚Üì
5. OUTPUT: Part1-ESCAPED.md (LaTeX-ready)
   ‚Üì
6. GENERATE: PDF via pandoc + template
```

### Size Guidelines
- **Optimal part size**: 12-15KB markdown
- **Maximum part size**: 50KB markdown
- **Split points**: Natural chapter boundaries
- **Typical structure**:
  - Part 1: Chapters 1-4 (Getting Started)
  - Part 2a: Chapters 5-8 (Core Concepts)
  - Part 2b: Chapters 9-12 (Advanced Topics)
  - Part 2c: Chapters 13-16 (Expert Material)

# PART 3: WORKING WITH EXISTING OPUS CONTENT

## üîç Recognizing Opus Strengths

When reviewing Opus-generated content, preserve these natural strengths:

### What Opus Does Well Naturally
- **Transitions**: Smoothly connects chapters and concepts
- **Voice consistency**: Maintains conversational tone throughout
- **Progressive complexity**: Naturally scaffolds from simple to complex
- **Celebration moments**: Includes "Look what you've learned" sections
- **Practical examples**: Tends toward working code over theory

### Enhancement Opportunities

**Where to focus improvements:**
1. **Missing content blocks** - Fill with newly trusted P2 sources
2. **Technical accuracy** - Verify against latest P2 documentation
3. **Exercise progression** - Ensure difficulty ladder is smooth
4. **Medicine Cabinet** - Add more alternatives for complex topics
5. **Visual elements** - Mark where diagrams would help

### Regeneration Decision Framework

**Regenerate when (CONTENT changes):**
- New trusted P2 sources become available
- Technical errors discovered in core concepts
- Community feedback identifies systematic gaps
- Pedagogical improvements would significantly help

**Edit only when (STYLE changes):**
- Visual presentation issues
- Template/formatting problems
- Typography or layout fixes
- Box styling adjustments

**Critical Principle**: Edit passes are NEVER for content. If content needs fixing, regenerate with improved guide/sources.

# PART 4: QUALITY CHECKLIST

## ‚úÖ Content Quality
- [ ] Follows deSilva voice (conversational, encouraging)
- [ ] Each chapter has clear Hook ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Practice flow
- [ ] Code examples are complete and tested
- [ ] "Your Turn" exercises are achievable
- [ ] Medicine Cabinet provides simpler alternatives
- [ ] Common Gotchas prevent real frustrations

## ‚úÖ Technical Quality
- [ ] No LaTeX commands in markdown
- [ ] No manual escaping of characters
- [ ] No style hints in content
- [ ] Box patterns used correctly
- [ ] File sizes within limits

## ‚úÖ Visual Quality (After PDF Generation)

- [ ] No duplicate titles in boxes
- [ ] Chapter numbers are sequential
- [ ] Page headers show chapter names
- [ ] Chapter/section numbering follows pedagogical pattern
- [ ] Draft warning page is professional (no emojis)
- [ ] Colored environment boxes render correctly

---

# Part 12: Document Structure & Numbering

## Pedagogical Numbering Scheme

### What We Use
- **Chapter Titles**: "Chapter 1: Your First Blink"
- **Section Numbers**: "1.1 The Hook", "1.2 Let's Build Something"
- **Depth**: Stop at section level (no 1.2.3.4 subsections)

### Why This Works
1. **Clear Learning Path**: Sequential chapters create natural progression
2. **Perfect Hierarchy**: Major concepts (chapters) with subtopics (sections)
3. **Easy Navigation**: "See section 2.3" is clearer than searching by title
4. **Not Overwhelming**: Avoids academic paper feel while maintaining structure
5. **Confidence Building**: Numbered progress gives psychological rewards
6. **Cross-Reference Friendly**: Enables quick lookups

### LaTeX Configuration
```latex
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{1}  % Number chapters and sections only
\titleformat{\chapter}
  {\normalfont\huge\bfseries}
  {\thechapter}  % Show chapter number
  {1em}          % Space between number and title
  {\Huge}
```

## Professional Draft Warning Page

### Design Principles
- **No emojis** (üöß, üîç, üé®) - Clean professional look
- **Clear hierarchy** - DRAFT warning, title, version, warning box
- **Red color scheme** - Immediate visual signal of draft status
- **Warning box** - Explains colored flags for incomplete sections

### Template Implementation
```latex
% Title page - Professional Draft Warning Style
{\fontsize{28}{34}\selectfont\bfseries\color{red}DRAFT - TECHNICAL REVIEW ONLY\par}
{\Large\color{red}NOT FOR RELEASE OR DISTRIBUTION\par}
```

## Technical Workflow Updates

### Markdown to PDF Pipeline
1. **Write clean markdown** using `::: sidetrack` div syntax
2. **Run LaTeX escape script** before PDF generation
3. **Use Lua filters** to convert divs to LaTeX environments
4. **Deploy to PDF Forge** with enhanced script

### Enhanced Request Format
```json
{
  "documents": [{
    "input": "document.md",
    "output": "document.pdf",
    "template": "p2kb-pasm-desilva",  // No path or extension
    "pandoc_args": [
      "--lua-filter=div-to-environment"  // No path or extension
    ],
    "variables": {
      "title": "Discovering P2 Assembly",
      "version": "0.1-DRAFT"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Key Improvements
- **Declarative requests** - No PDF Forge structure knowledge needed
- **Consistent patterns** - Templates and filters work the same way
- **Clean markdown** - Div syntax instead of raw LaTeX
- **Proper escaping** - Automated handling of LaTeX special characters

# APPENDIX: Common Issues & Solutions

## Issue: Box Title Duplication
**Problem**: "Sidetrack: Sidetrack: Content"
**Cause**: Adding title inside box content
**Solution**: Let template add the title

## Issue: Yellow Inline Code
**Problem**: Inline code has yellow background
**Cause**: Wrong template command
**Solution**: Use `\texttt{\textbf{}}` not `\colorbox`

## Issue: Escaped Characters in Output
**Problem**: Seeing `\^` instead of `^`
**Cause**: Manual escaping or double-escaping
**Solution**: Write naturally, let script escape once

## Issue: Missing Content Not Visible
**Problem**: Missing sections blend into text
**Cause**: Not using `:::missing` pattern
**Solution**: Always mark missing content explicitly
