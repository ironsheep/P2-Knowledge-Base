# üî¥ READ-ONLY PROTECTION NOTICE üî¥

## THIS DIRECTORY IS PROTECTED

### opus-master/ Directory Status
**STATUS**: READ-ONLY REFERENCE (pending generation)
**PURPOSE**: Preserved original Opus 4.1 generation  
**PROTECTION LEVEL**: ABSOLUTE - NO EDITS ALLOWED (once generated)

## Critical Rules

### ‚õî NEVER MODIFY THESE FILES (once generated)
- `opus-master/COMPLETE-OPUS-MASTER.md` - Original Opus 4.1 master document
- `opus-master/README-SACRED.md` - Original protection notice

### ‚úÖ CORRECT WORKFLOW
1. **READ** from opus-master for reference
2. **COPY** sections to workspace for editing
3. **EDIT** only in workspace directories
4. **PRESERVE** opus-master unchanged

### üìç Directory Locations
- **Reference (READ-ONLY)**: `/engineering/document-production/manuals/p2-debug-window-manual/opus-master/`
- **Working copies**: `/engineering/document-production/workspace/p2-debug-window-manual/`
- **PDF Generation**: `/engineering/pdf-forge/production/p2-debug-window-manual/`
- **Deployment**: `/engineering/document-production/outbound/p2-debug-window-manual/`

## Why This Matters

The opus-master will represent the original creative work generated by Opus 4.1 with:
- Discovery Guide voice and pedagogical structure
- Progressive learning flow from basic DEBUG to advanced techniques
- JonnyMac's revolutionary layer system discoveries
- Comprehensive coverage of all 9 debug window types
- Professional debugging workflow patterns

This will be the gold standard reference that must be preserved unchanged.

## Phase 1 Foundation

The opus-master generation builds upon:
- **12 comprehensive study documents** (~400KB total)
- **45 discovered YAML gaps** documented and prioritized
- **JonnyMac layer system** providing 20√ó performance improvement
- **PC input integration** for bidirectional debugging
- **Multi-window coordination patterns** for professional workflows

## Generation Timeline

**Phase 1**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Comprehensive studies of all 9 window types
**Phase 2**: üöß PENDING - Opus 4.1 generation of complete manual (~55 hours)

Once generated, the master document will be:
1. Immediately set to read-only (chmod 444)
2. Committed to git for version control
3. Used as source for all derivative work

## Lessons Learned

Based on the De Silva manual experience (nearly lost on 2025-08-22):
- **Protect immediately** after generation
- **Document everything** about the generation process
- **Version control** is critical for preservation
- **Never edit masters** - always work on copies
