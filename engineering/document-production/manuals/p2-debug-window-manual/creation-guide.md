# P2 Debug Window Manual - Creation Guide

**Canonical Name:** `p2-debug-window-manual`

## üéØ Document Purpose
Creating a comprehensive practical guide to P2's Debug Window system - the built-in visualization and monitoring capabilities that make P2 development uniquely interactive and accessible.

### Document Philosophy
**"Visual Discovery Through Systematic Exploration"**
- **Transform basic DEBUG usage into expert-level debugging strategies**
- **Explore all 9 window types beyond SPIN-2 v5.1's minimal examples**
- **Discover rich parameter combinations through systematic experimentation**
- **Provide immediate visual verification** - every code example paired with actual screenshot
- **Bridge the capability gap** - users know basics but miss the sophisticated possibilities

### Core Problem This Manual Solves
**The "Iceberg Effect"**: Developers use basic `DEBUG()` syntax but remain unaware of:
- 9 specialized window types with rich parameter systems
- Advanced visualization capabilities hiding in plain sight
- PASM assembly debugging possibilities
- Professional debugging workflows and patterns
- Parameter interactions that create powerful debugging displays

**Our Solution**: Systematic capability discovery with visual proof of every technique.

## üö´ No Handwaving Principle

### Fundamental Documentation Rule

**Technical documentation must be based on verified sources, not assumptions about what "should" exist.**

This principle is MANDATORY for all P2 documentation to prevent the creation of plausible but non-existent features.

### Examples of Handwaving (FORBIDDEN)

‚ùå **Assuming features because similar systems have them:**
- "The LOGIC window probably has protocol decoders like professional logic analyzers"
- "There must be automatic measurements since all scopes have them"
- "Resource limits should be around 16 windows like typical systems"

‚ùå **Filling gaps with plausible speculation:**
- "Maximum terminal size is likely 80x50 based on USB bandwidth"
- "Each instance uses approximately 16 bytes of P2 RAM"
- "Update rates of 10-20Hz are optimal for performance"

‚ùå **Stating assumptions as facts:**
- "The system supports up to 16 simultaneous windows"
- "Protocol decoders automatically identify I2C, SPI, and UART"
- "Automatic measurements include Vpp, frequency, and rise time"

### Proper Documentation (REQUIRED)

‚úÖ **Citing sources:**
- "According to Spin2 v5.1 reference, DEBUG supports 9 window types"
- "Pascal source code examination reveals hover coordinate display"
- "Testing confirms TRACE modes range from 0-15"

‚úÖ **Marking unknowns as unknown:**
- "Resource limits are not documented in available sources"
- "Maximum window count is application-specific, not system-defined"
- "Protocol decoding capabilities not found in documentation"

‚úÖ **Documenting only verified features:**
- "LOGIC window displays digital signals (no automatic decoding found)"
- "Mouse hover shows coordinates (discovered in Pascal source)"
- "SPRITE commands use first 8 of 16 TRACE modes (tested)"

### Why This Matters

Handwaving has caused significant documentation errors:
- Protocol decoder speculation misled users about LOGIC capabilities
- Automatic measurement assumptions created false expectations
- Resource limit guesses provided incorrect constraints
- Hover behavior speculation added non-existent GUI features

### Implementation Checklist

Before documenting ANY feature:
1. ‚òê Is this explicitly stated in official documentation?
2. ‚òê Has this been verified through testing?
3. ‚òê Is the source clearly cited?
4. ‚òê Are assumptions clearly marked as speculation?
5. ‚òê Are gaps acknowledged rather than filled?

**REMEMBER**: It's better to document a gap than to fill it with plausible fiction. Users need accurate information about what DOES exist, not speculation about what MIGHT exist.

# PART 1: CONTENT CREATION (What Authors Write)

## üìù Content Philosophy

### The "Discovery Guide" Voice

**Voice Identity**: Professional Explorer - Systematic discovery with visual excitement

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Exploratory Excitement**: "Let's see what this parameter combination does..."
- **Visual Revelation**: "Watch what happens when we change this setting..."
- **Professional Discovery**: "This technique reveals..." / "The output shows us..."
- **Systematic Exploration**: "Now let's try the next parameter..."
- **Immediate Gratification**: "Look at that - instant visualization!"
- **Visual Confidence**: "This screenshot shows exactly what your debug window should display"

**Why This Voice Works:**
- **Matches Discovery Content**: Exploration-focused manual needs exploration-focused voice
- **Celebrates Visual Learning**: Voice reinforces "aha!" moments screenshots provide
- **Professional yet Engaging**: Reference-quality but maintains discovery excitement
- **Problem-Solving Oriented**: Each technique solves real debugging challenges

**Voice Pattern Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "Here's a technique most developers haven't discovered..."
- ‚úÖ "The visual difference is immediately apparent - no guessing needed"
- ‚úÖ "When we set the plot style to 2, watch how the dual axes transform our data view..."
- ‚úÖ "This parameter combination creates something remarkable..."
- ‚úÖ "The screenshot reveals exactly what's happening in your program"

**Voice DON'Ts:**
- ‚ùå Overly tutorial language ("Let's learn about debug windows together")
- ‚ùå Dry reference style ("Parameter 2 accepts values 0-7")
- ‚ùå Uncertainty hedging ("This might help with debugging")
- ‚ùå Academic formality ("One observes that the visualization demonstrates...")

### Progressive Debug Learning Structure

## üîß **CRITICAL: Minimal Hardware Design Philosophy**

### Universal Accessibility Requirement

**Core Principle**: Examples must be accessible to beginners with minimal external hardware requirements. Focus on simple-to-generate projects that demonstrate rich visualization techniques without specialized equipment.

### Hardware Accessibility Levels

**Level 0: Software-Only Examples** (Preferred)
- **Built-in P2 resources only**: 2 LEDs, CORDIC engine, multiple COGs, RNG, internal timers
- **Mathematical demonstrations**: Waveform generation, signal processing, algorithm visualization
- **Software simulation**: Protocol patterns, sensor networks, control systems
- **Learning focus**: Debug techniques and visualization concepts

**Level 1: Built-in Hardware Only** 
- **P2 board resources**: LED1, LED2 for binary visualization
- **Simple demonstrations**: PWM visualization, binary patterns, state indication
- **Interactive examples**: PC mouse/keyboard control of LED patterns

**Level 2: Minimal External Components** (Optional)
- **Single wire connections**: Simple switches, basic sensors
- **Clear documentation**: Exact wiring diagrams and component specifications  
- **Alternative provided**: Software simulation version always included

**Level 3: Advanced Projects** (Reference Only)
- **Complex hardware setups**: For experienced developers who want to extend
- **Professional applications**: Real-world integration examples
- **Not required for learning**: Core concepts taught in Levels 0-1

### Software Simulation Strategy

**Rich Scenarios from Simple Sources**:
```spin2
' Motor control analysis - no motor required!
PRI simulate_motor_system()
  repeat
    ' Software-generated encoder feedback
    encoder_pos := (encoder_pos + pwm_duty/100) & $FFFF
    ' Simulated load variation  
    load_torque := GETRND() & $FF
    ' Debug with multiple windows
    DEBUG(`motor_scope SCOPE_XY `(pwm_duty) `(encoder_pos))
```

**Educational Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Immediate accessibility**: Copy, paste, run - see results instantly
- ‚úÖ **Concept focus**: Visualization techniques, not hardware debugging
- ‚úÖ **Rapid experimentation**: Try variations without rewiring
- ‚úÖ **Universal applicability**: Anyone with P2 board can follow along
- ‚úÖ **Professional transfer**: Simulation skills apply to real projects

### Implementation Guidelines

**Every example must include**:
1. **Software-only version** demonstrating the core debug concept
2. **Clear learning objective** focusing on debug visualization technique
3. **Immediate executability** with just P2 board + PC connection
4. **Progressive complexity** within each accessibility level
5. **Hardware extension notes** showing how to apply to real sensors (optional)

**Avoid**:
- ‚ùå **Complex external hardware** requirements
- ‚ùå **Specialized test equipment** dependencies
- ‚ùå **Expensive sensors or components**
- ‚ùå **Complex wiring** that distracts from debug learning
- ‚ùå **Platform-specific tools** or development environments

## üìñ Code Example Design Principles

### The "Debug-Driven" Pattern

**Show the problem FIRST, then the debug solution:**
```pasm2
' PROBLEM: LED blinks too fast
        drvh    #56
        waitx   #1000      ' Intended 1ms delay
        drvl    #56
        waitx   #1000
        jmp     #$-4

' DEBUG SOLUTION: Monitor actual timing
        drvh    #56
        debug   "LED ON at ", udec_(getct())
        waitx   #1000
        drvl    #56  
        debug   "LED OFF at ", udec_(getct())
        waitx   #1000
        jmp     #$-8
```

### The "Before and After" Pattern

**Show program behavior without debug, then with debug:**
```markdown
**Without Debug**: Program runs but doesn't work correctly
**With Debug**: Clear visibility into what's actually happening
**Result**: Quick identification and resolution of the issue
```

### Code Example Naming Convention

**Format**: `' Debug Example - [Scenario] - [Technique]`

**Examples:**
- `' Debug Example - Serial Dropouts - Buffer Monitoring`
- `' Debug Example - COG Timing - Synchronization Check`
- `' Debug Example - Memory Issues - Address Validation`
- `' Debug Example - Interrupt Problems - State Logging`

## üíä The Debug Medicine Cabinet Pattern

### Types of Debug Medicine

**Type 1: Quick Debug Check**
```markdown
Overwhelmed by complex debug output?
Medicine: Start with simple DEBUG statements showing just one variable
```

**Type 2: Visual Debug Alternative**
```markdown
Hard to interpret numerical debug output?
Medicine: Use LED patterns or terminal graphics for visual feedback
```

**Type 3: Systematic Debug Process**
```markdown
Don't know where to start debugging?
Medicine: Follow the "Half-Split" method - eliminate half the code as source
```

## üö´ Content DON'Ts

### NEVER Include Style Information
‚ùå "This debug output should be in a monospace box"
‚ùå "Make the debug tip yellow"
‚ùå "Use red text for error messages"
‚úÖ Just show the debug content - template handles appearance

### NEVER Use Platform-Specific Debug Tools
‚ùå References to specific terminal programs
‚ùå Assume particular development environment
‚ùå Platform-specific debug utilities
‚úÖ Focus on P2 built-in debug capabilities

### NEVER Assume Debug Hardware
‚ùå "Connect your logic analyzer..."
‚ùå "Using an oscilloscope, measure..."
‚ùå "Set up your JTAG debugger..."
‚úÖ Use P2's built-in debug system exclusively
