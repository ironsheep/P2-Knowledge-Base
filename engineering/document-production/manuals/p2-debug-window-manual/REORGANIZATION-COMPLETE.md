# Opus-Master Reorganization Complete

**Date**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully reorganized

## What Was Done

### Cleaned up opus-master folder
Now contains ONLY sacred Opus-generated content:
```
opus-master/
├── README-SACRED.md              # Protection documentation
├── GENERATION-SUMMARY.md         # Generation process record
├── COMPLETE-OPUS-MASTER.md       # The full 74KB assembled manual
└── chapters/                     # Individual sections
    ├── chapter-01 through 14     # All chapters
    └── appendix-a through e      # All appendices
```

### Moved working files to appropriate locations
- `code-validation/` → Parent directory with opus-extracted-examples subfolder
- `examples-library/` → Parent directory  
- `p2-debug-window-manual-try0.md` & `try1.md` → `drafts/`
- `MANUAL-COMPLETION-PLAN.md` → `planning/`
- `screenshot-checklist.md` → `assets-needed/`

## Current Structure

```
p2-debug-window-manual/
├── opus-master/           # Sacred masters only (clean!)
├── code-validation/       # All validation work
│   └── opus-extracted-examples/  # Examples from opus-master
├── examples-library/      # Compiled examples
├── drafts/               # Early attempts (try0, try1)
├── planning/             # Planning documents
├── assets-needed/        # Screenshot checklist
└── studies/              # Research and analysis
```

## Git Status
All changes have been tracked with proper git moves/adds. Ready to commit.

## Benefits
- **opus-master is now pure** - Contains only Opus-generated sacred content
- **Clear separation** - Working files separate from reference files
- **Better organization** - Each file type has its proper home
- **Protection ready** - Can now set read-only on opus-master if desired

## Next Steps
Now that opus-master is clean and organized, we can:
1. Proceed with the code completeness updates
2. Work from the COMPLETE-OPUS-MASTER.md as reference
3. Make updates in workspace copies, not the master
