# Chapter Analysis Before Assembly

## Current Chapter Files and Naming

### Chapters 1-6 (No suffix)
- chapter-01-vision-gap.md (204 lines)
- chapter-02-terminal-mastery.md (538 lines)
- chapter-03-graphics-breakthrough.md (583 lines)
- chapter-04-layer-composition.md (541 lines)
- chapter-05-pc-input-integration.md (721 lines)
- chapter-06-professional-instruments.md (689 lines)

### Chapters 7-14 (All marked "-FULL")
- chapter-07-packed-data-FULL.md (395 lines)
- chapter-08-plot-window-FULL.md (514 lines)
- chapter-09-logic-window-FULL.md (718 lines)
- chapter-10-scope-windows-FULL.md (677 lines)
- chapter-11-frequency-domain-FULL.md (597 lines)
- chapter-12-multi-window-FULL.md (715 lines)
- chapter-13-pasm-integration-FULL.md (800 lines)
- chapter-14-production-workflows-FULL.md (780 lines)

### Special Case: Chapter 9 Has Two Versions
- chapter-09-logic-window-FIXED.md (364 lines) - Half the size
- chapter-09-logic-window-FULL.md (718 lines) - Complete version

## Analysis of Chapter 9 Versions

### FIXED Version (364 lines):
- 15 code examples
- Appears to be abbreviated
- Ends with basic summary

### FULL Version (718 lines):
- 21 code examples  
- Twice the content
- Ends with comprehensive summary
- More detailed protocol analysis

## Naming Pattern Analysis

The "-FULL" suffix appears on chapters 7-14, which suggests:

1. **Possibility 1**: These were expanded after initial drafts
2. **Possibility 2**: There were abbreviated versions that got replaced
3. **Possibility 3**: Just inconsistent naming during creation

The fact that Chapter 9 has both FIXED and FULL suggests there were revisions, and FULL is the complete version.

## Recommendations for Assembly

### For Chapter 9:
Use the **FULL** version (718 lines) because:
- It has twice the content
- More code examples
- More comprehensive coverage
- The FIXED version seems abbreviated

### For Naming:
After assembly, consider whether to:
1. Keep the "-FULL" suffixes (shows which were expanded)
2. Remove all suffixes for consistency
3. Document the versioning history

## Assembly Plan

When creating COMPLETE-OPUS-MASTER.md:

1. Use chapters 1-6 as-is (no suffix versions)
2. Use chapter-09-logic-window-FULL.md (not FIXED)
3. Use chapters 7-8, 10-14 with -FULL suffix
4. Include all appendices

This will create a ~10,000+ line complete manual with all the detailed content.

## Questions to Resolve

1. Should we keep the -FULL suffixes in the final assembly?
2. Should we archive the FIXED version of Chapter 9?
3. Do we want consistent chapter naming?

The content is what matters most - the naming can be standardized later.
