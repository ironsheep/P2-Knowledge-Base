# Technical Debt for Debug Window Manual V2

**Document**: complete-opus-master-v2.md  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: For future enhancement

## Additional Image Placeholders Needed

While V2 includes strategic image placeholders for first window type introductions and key debugging victories, several novel multi-window coordination scenarios would benefit from visual representation in future iterations.

### Identified Opportunities for Additional Images

#### 1. State Machine Visualization Dashboard
- **Location**: Line ~6676
- **Description**: Complete FSM visibility with state diagram, timing chart, variables plot, and event log
- **Value**: Shows how multiple window types work together for complete state machine debugging
- **Window Types**: PLOT (diagram) + LOGIC (timing) + PLOT (variables) + TERM (log)

#### 2. Automotive Multi-Gauge Dashboard  
- **Location**: Line ~2807
- **Description**: Multiple sprite-based gauges showing speed, RPM, temperature with warning zones
- **Value**: Demonstrates professional instrument cluster using layer system
- **Window Type**: BITMAP with multiple sprite layers

#### 3. Waterfall Spectrum Display
- **Location**: Line ~4022
- **Description**: 3D visualization showing frequency evolution over time
- **Value**: Shows patterns invisible in single FFT snapshots
- **Window Type**: PLOT with intensity mapping

#### 4. Interactive PID Parameter Tuning
- **Location**: Line ~2362
- **Description**: Terminal for live parameter adjustment with multiple response plots
- **Value**: Shows real-time tuning with immediate visual feedback
- **Window Types**: TERM (control) + Multiple PLOT windows

#### 5. I2C Multi-Device Protocol Analysis
- **Location**: Various I2C examples
- **Description**: Multiple I2C devices being monitored simultaneously
- **Value**: Shows parallel protocol debugging across multiple buses
- **Window Type**: LOGIC with 6+ channels

### Rationale for Deferral

These examples represent advanced use cases that, while pedagogically valuable, can be understood from the text description and code. Adding images for these would:
- Enhance understanding of multi-window coordination
- Provide visual proof of complex debugging scenarios
- Inspire users to create similar multi-window dashboards

However, the core concepts are adequately covered by the existing 7 strategic image placeholders in V2.

### Recommendation

Consider adding these images in a future V3 revision after gathering user feedback on which multi-window scenarios are most commonly implemented or most difficult to understand from text alone.

### Implementation Notes

If adding these images later:
1. Use same placeholder format: `[DEBUG-WINDOW-IMAGE: description | dimensions | type | content]`
2. Ensure screenshots show actual P2 hardware output where possible
3. Highlight the coordination between windows (arrows, annotations)
4. Consider animated GIFs for dynamic interactions

## Other Technical Debt Items

### 1. FFT/SPECTRO Window Examples
- Currently no concrete FFT or SPECTRO window examples in main content
- These specialized windows deserve dedicated examples with images
- Consider adding in audio analysis or vibration monitoring context

### 2. MIDI Window Documentation
- MIDI window type mentioned but no examples provided
- Need to add MIDI debugging scenarios
- Would benefit from visual representation of MIDI events

### 3. Screenshot Standardization
- Need consistent screenshot dimensions and quality
- Establish color palette for annotations
- Create template for multi-window layout screenshots

**Priority**: Low - Document is functional without these enhancements  
**Effort**: Medium - Requires P2 hardware setup and screenshot capture  
**Impact**: High - Would significantly enhance learning experience for advanced topics
