# ðŸ”´ SACRED MASTER DOCUMENT - DO NOT MODIFY ðŸ”´

## This Directory Contains the Opus-Generated Master

**Files**: 
- `complete-opus-master-v0.md` - Full manual (10,370 lines) assembled from all chapters
- `summary-opus-master-v0.md` - Condensed summary version (2,672 lines)
**Model**: Claude Opus 4.1
**Status**: READ-ONLY (version 0 - original generation)
**Purpose**: P2 Debug Window Manual - Initial versions before any fixes

## What This Will Contain

This will be the complete 14-chapter P2 Debug Window Manual generated by Opus 4.1, including:
- Full front matter (preface, acknowledgments, introduction)
- Part I: Foundation (Chapters 1-3)
- Part II: Interactive Applications (Chapters 4-6)
- Part III: Data Efficiency (Chapters 7-8)
- Part IV: Advanced Analysis (Chapters 9-11)
- Part V: Integration Mastery (Chapters 12-14)
- Appendices A-D (Command Reference, Packed Data, Performance, Examples)
- Complete index and cross-references

## Why This Is Sacred

1. **Opus Time is Expensive** - This represents ~55 hours of Opus 4.1 generation time
2. **Cannot Be Regenerated** - The exact prompt context and Phase 1 studies would be lost
3. **Source of Truth** - All workspace edits and PDF generation derive from this
4. **Discovery Guide Voice** - Opus 4.1's unique pedagogical approach must be preserved
5. **JonnyMac Patterns** - Revolutionary layer system discoveries documented here first

## How to Use This Master

### â›” NEVER DO THIS
- Edit the COMPLETE-OPUS-MASTER.md file directly
- Move or rename files in this directory
- Change permissions from read-only

### âœ… CORRECT WORKFLOW
1. **READ** from opus-master for reference and source material
2. **COPY** sections to `/workspace/p2-debug-window-manual/` for editing
3. **EDIT** only in workspace directories
4. **PRESERVE** opus-master unchanged as reference

## Generation Process

This master will be generated through:
1. Phase 1 comprehensive studies (COMPLETED - 12 documents, ~400KB)
2. Phase 2 systematic chapter creation using Opus 4.1
3. Integration of all discovered patterns and techniques
4. Validation against P2 knowledge base and compiler

## Lessons from De Silva Manual

We almost lost the De Silva opus-master on 2025-08-22. It was hiding in an archive folder and only recovered through careful investigation. This taught us:

1. **Protect immediately** - Set read-only as soon as generation completes
2. **Document location** - Always record where masters are stored
3. **Version control** - Commit to git immediately after generation
4. **Never trust memory** - Document the process and location

## Recovery Instructions

If this master is ever lost:
1. Check context keys for generation timestamps
2. Search for ~500KB+ markdown files in workspace/outbound
3. Verify against Phase 1 study documents
4. Check git history for large file additions
