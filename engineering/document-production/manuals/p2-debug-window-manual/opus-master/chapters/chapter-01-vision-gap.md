# Chapter 1: Beyond Basic DEBUG - The Vision Gap

*You've been using DEBUG() to print values. You're about to discover that you've only seen 5% of what P2's debug system can do.*

## The Debug Iceberg Effect

Every P2 developer starts with simple DEBUG statements:

```spin2
PUB main()
  repeat
    count++
    DEBUG(udec(count))  ' Prints: 1, 2, 3...
```

This works. It's useful. And it's just the tip of the iceberg.

What you don't see below the surface: Nine specialized window types. Interactive controls. Real-time visualization. Performance monitoring without external tools. Bidirectional communication with your PC. Graphics that update 20× faster than you thought possible.

This manual reveals what's hidden beneath.

## The Capability Discovery Journey

Let me show you the progression most developers never make:

### Stage 1: Text Output (Where Everyone Starts)
```spin2
DEBUG("LED State: ", udec(led_state))
```
You get text. It scrolls. You search through output. It works, but...

### Stage 2: The First "Aha!" - Formatted Display
```spin2
DEBUG(`TERM MyData POS 100 200 COLOR 2)
DEBUG(`MyData 'Value: ' udec_(value) `(20))
```
Suddenly your debug output stays in one place. No more scrolling. Clean display. But we're just getting started.

### Stage 3: Visual Breakthrough - Graphics Windows
```spin2
DEBUG(`PLOT MyScope SIZE 256 256 COLOR 2 3)
repeat
  DEBUG(`MyScope `(x, y))  ' Real-time plotting!
```
Your data becomes visual. Patterns emerge that numbers never revealed. This changes everything.

### Stage 4: Interactive Discovery - PC Input
```spin2
repeat
  key := DEBUG(PC_KEY)     ' Your keyboard controls the P2!
  mouse := DEBUG(PC_MOUSE)  ' Your mouse too!
  ' Adjust parameters in real-time during debugging
```
Now debugging becomes interactive. Change values. Test scenarios. All without recompiling.

### Stage 5: Professional Integration - Multi-Window Workflows
```spin2
' Monitor serial data
DEBUG(`TERM SerialMon POS 0 0 SIZE 50 20)
' Visualize timing
DEBUG(`SCOPE Timing SIZE 256 128 SAMPLES 256)
' Track digital signals  
DEBUG(`LOGIC Signals SIZE 256 128 SAMPLES 1024)
```
Multiple synchronized views. Complete system visibility. Professional debugging.

## Real Development Scenarios Where Text Debugging Fails

### Scenario 1: The Intermittent Glitch
Your motor controller works 99% of the time. Occasionally it jerks. Text debugging shows normal values... when you can catch it.

**Visual Evidence Solution:**
```spin2
DEBUG(`SCOPE_XY MotorPlot SIZE 256 256 RANGE 1000 BACK_COLOR 0)
repeat
  current := read_motor_current()
  position := read_encoder()
  DEBUG(`MotorPlot `(current, position))
```
The glitch appears as a visual spike. Pattern recognition beats number scanning every time.

### Scenario 2: Multi-COG Timing Conflicts
Three COGs communicate through shared memory. Sometimes data corrupts. Text output from each COG interleaves chaotically.

**Multi-Window Solution:**
```spin2
' Each COG gets its own debug window
DEBUG(`TERM COG0 POS 0 0 SIZE 30 10 COLOR 2)
DEBUG(`TERM COG1 POS 300 0 SIZE 30 10 COLOR 3)  
DEBUG(`TERM COG2 POS 600 0 SIZE 30 10 COLOR 4)

' Plus timing visualization
DEBUG(`LOGIC Timing SIZE 512 200 SAMPLES 2048)
```
Separate windows. Clear timing. Problem visible immediately.

### Scenario 3: Serial Communication Mysteries
Your UART drops characters under load. Printf debugging affects timing. Heisenbug territory.

**Non-Invasive Analysis:**
```spin2
DEBUG(`LOGIC Serial SIZE 512 128 SAMPLES 4096 TRIGGER $55)
repeat
  tx_byte(data)
  DEBUG(`Serial `(tx_pin, rx_pin))  ' Capture without affecting timing
```
The LOGIC window reveals timing violations your text debug would never show.

## P2's Unique Debug Advantages

### Built-In, No External Tools Required
- No logic analyzer needed - LOGIC window handles 32 channels
- No oscilloscope required - SCOPE window provides 4-channel analysis
- No spectrum analyzer - FFT window shows frequency domain
- No protocol analyzer - Built-in triggering and decode

### Zero-Cost Debug Infrastructure
```spin2
' Traditional embedded debugging
connect_jtag()      ' ❌ Needs hardware debugger
setup_swo_trace()   ' ❌ Requires special pins
configure_etm()     ' ❌ Complex setup

' P2 debugging
DEBUG("Ready!")     ' ✅ Just works
```

### Non-Invasive Visualization
Your debug windows run in parallel with your application:
- No stopping at breakpoints
- No timing disruption
- No probe effects
- Real-time continuous monitoring

### The Interactive Advantage
```spin2
' Imagine debugging a PID controller
repeat
  key := DEBUG(PC_KEY)
  case key
    "+": kp += 0.1    ' Tune parameters
    "-": kp -= 0.1    ' While running!
    
  output := pid_calculate(setpoint, actual, kp, ki, kd)
  DEBUG(`PLOT PID `(setpoint) `(actual) `(output))
```
Tune, test, visualize - all in real-time. No edit-compile-download cycle.
