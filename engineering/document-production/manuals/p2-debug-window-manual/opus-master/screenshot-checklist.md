## Appendices
No specific screenshots required for appendices - they contain reference material and code examples.

## Capture Guidelines

### Setup Requirements
1. Use consistent P2 development board
2. Ensure clean, professional window arrangement
3. Use realistic data (not random noise)
4. Include window titles and controls where applicable
5. Show relevant features being demonstrated

### Visual Quality
1. Clear, readable text and labels
2. Good contrast between signal and background
3. Meaningful data patterns (not just test patterns)
4. Professional color schemes
5. No overlapping or cut-off elements

### Content Requirements
1. Each screenshot should clearly demonstrate its intended feature
2. Include enough context to understand what's being shown
3. Use real-world examples where possible
4. Show both simple and complex cases
5. Highlight the key feature being demonstrated

## Total Screenshots Required: 56

## Notes
- Screenshots can be captured during actual debugging sessions for authenticity
- Consider creating a demo program that generates all required displays
- Some screenshots may require specific hardware setup or signal sources
- Coordinate with technical reviewers for accuracy verification
