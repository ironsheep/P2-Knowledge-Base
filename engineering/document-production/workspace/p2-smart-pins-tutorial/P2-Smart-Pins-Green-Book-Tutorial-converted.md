## Preface: Your Complete Journey into P2 I/O

Welcome, my friend! You're about to discover the complete input/output capabilities of the Propeller 2. We'll start with the basics - simple pin control - and build up to one of the P2's most powerful features: Smart Pins.

### What Makes This Tutorial Special?

This isn't just a Smart Pins reference (we have the Blue Book for that). This is your complete guided journey from "How do I control a pin?" through "What's a Smart Pin?" all the way to "I can't believe what I just built!" We'll start simple, build confidence, and before you know it, you'll be orchestrating all 64 I/O pins like a maestro conducting a symphony.

### Who Is This For?

Are you new to the P2? Perfect! We'll start with the absolute basics.
Are you a P1 veteran? Excellent! You'll appreciate the familiar instructions before diving into Smart Pins.
Are you somewhere in between? You're exactly where you need to be.

The only requirement is curiosity and a willingness to experiment. P2 I/O is best learned by doing, and we'll be doing plenty!

### How to Use This Tutorial

**The Learning Path** (recommended for first-timers):
Start with Chapter 0 to understand basic I/O, then read Part I to understand Smart Pins conceptually, then work through Part II mode by mode. Each section builds on concepts from previous ones. By Part III, you'll be combining techniques in ways that would make other microcontrollers jealous.

**The Project Path** (when you have something specific in mind):
If you just need basic I/O, Chapter 0 has you covered. For Smart Pins, jump to the mode you need in Part II, but don't skip the introduction - it contains crucial concepts. Each mode chapter stands alone but references related modes.

**The Reference Path** (when you know what you're doing):
Chapter 0 has quick reference tables for basic I/O. Part II has quick reference boxes at the start of each Smart Pin mode. The appendices contain every constant, every formula, every detail you might need.

### A Personal Note from Your Guide

I've been working with microcontrollers since before they were "micro," and I can honestly say that the P2's I/O system represents something special. Starting with familiar, simple pin control and building up to Smart Pins that can handle complex protocols independently - that's a beautiful progression.

You'll make mistakes. Your first pin might not toggle. Your first Smart Pin might not work. Your timing might be off. That's normal! Every example in this tutorial has been tested, retested, and tested again. When something doesn't work, we'll show you why and how to fix it.

Ready? Let's start with the basics and build up to the amazing!

# Part I: Understanding P2 I/O - From Basic to Smart

## Chapter 0: P2 I/O Fundamentals - Before Smart Pins

### Why Start Here?

Before we dive into the sophisticated world of Smart Pins, let's establish a solid foundation with basic P2 I/O. If you're coming from other microcontrollers (or even the P1), you'll find familiar concepts here. More importantly, understanding what basic I/O can and can't do will help you appreciate why Smart Pins are revolutionary.

### 0.1 The Four Essential Instructions

Forget what you might have seen about 32+ pin instructions. You really only need four to get started:

::: spin2
```
PUB the_essentials()
  DIRL #56              ' Make P56 an input (Direction Low)
  DIRH #56              ' Make P56 an output (Direction High)
  OUTL #56              ' Set P56 output to 0 (Output Low)
  OUTH #56              ' Set P56 output to 1 (Output High)
```
:::

That's it! With just these four instructions, you can:
- Control LEDs
- Read buttons
- Create simple signals
- Interface with basic digital devices

Let's see them in action with the classic "Hello World" of embedded systems:

::: spin2
```
CON
  _clkfreq = 200_000_000        ' 200MHz system clock
  LED = 56                      ' P2 Eval board LED

PUB blink_basic()
  DIRH #LED                     ' Make LED pin an output
  repeat
    OUTH #LED                   ' LED on
    waitms(500)                 ' Wait 500ms
    OUTL #LED                   ' LED off
    waitms(500)                 ' Wait 500ms
```
:::

Simple, right? Now let's read a button:

::: spin2
```
CON
  BUTTON = 32                   ' Button on P32

PUB read_button() : pressed
  DIRL #BUTTON                  ' Make button pin an input
  pressed := INA[BUTTON]        ' Read the pin state
  ' Returns 1 if pressed (assuming active-high button)
```
:::

### 0.2 Reading Inputs - The INA and INB Registers

The P2 has 64 I/O pins, split across two 32-bit registers:
- **INA[31..0]** - Read pins P0 through P31
- **INB[31..0]** - Read pins P32 through P63

::: spin2
```
PUB read_multiple_inputs()
  ' Make P0-P7 inputs
  DIRL #0 ADDPINS 7             ' Set P0..P7 as inputs
  
  ' Read all 8 pins at once
  value := INA[7..0]            ' Get 8-bit value from P0-P7
  
  ' Or read individually
  button1 := INA[0]             ' Read P0
  button2 := INA[1]             ' Read P1
  sensor  := INA[2]             ' Read P2
```
:::

**Important:** Input pins read the actual pin state, regardless of the output register setting. This means you can read back what you're outputting (useful for debugging).

### 0.3 Understanding Pin Timing (Simplified)

When you control pins, there's a tiny delay between your instruction and the pin actually changing:

::: needs-diagram
Basic I/O output timing diagram showing DRVH instruction and the 3-clock delay before pin changes
:::

**What this means in practice**: At 200MHz, the 3-clock delay is only 15 nanoseconds - essentially instant for LEDs, buttons, and most I/O!

Similarly, when reading pins:

::: needs-diagram
Basic I/O input sampling diagram showing that pins are sampled 2-3 clocks before the instruction reads them
:::

**The bottom line**: For most projects, you can completely ignore these delays! They only matter when:
- Bit-banging high-speed protocols (>10MHz)
- Synchronizing with external hardware
- Creating precise timing patterns

> ðŸ“˜ **Need exact timing?** See the Blue Book's "Pin Timing Specifications" appendix for clock-by-clock details essential for high-speed protocols.

### 0.4 The Pattern Behind Pin Instructions

Now that you've mastered the essential four, let's understand the full pattern. The P2 actually provides four operations, each with eight variants:

**The Four Operations:**
1. **DIR** - Control pin direction (input/output)
2. **OUT** - Control output state (0/1)
3. **FLT** - Float pins (make input while preserving output register)
4. **DRV** - Drive pins (make output and set level simultaneously)

**The Eight Variants (for each operation):**
- **L** - Low (0) - *You'll use this constantly*
- **H** - High (1) - *You'll use this constantly*
- **C** - Copy from Carry flag
- **NC** - NOT Carry (inverse of Carry flag)
- **Z** - Copy from Zero flag
- **NZ** - NOT Zero (inverse of Zero flag)
- **RND** - Random value (useful for testing)
- **NOT** - Invert current state - *Occasionally useful*

This gives us 4 Ã— 8 = 32 instructions, but remember: **You'll use the L and H variants 95% of the time!**

Here's a practical example using the NOT variant:

::: spin2
```
PUB toggle_led()
  DIRH #56                      ' Make P56 an output
  repeat
    OUTNOT #56                  ' Toggle the LED state
    waitms(500)                 ' Wait 500ms
    ' No need to track on/off state - NOT does it for us!
```
:::

### 0.5 Practical I/O Patterns

Let's look at some common patterns you'll use in real projects:

#### Button Debouncing

::: spin2
```
PUB debounced_button() : pressed | sample1, sample2
  DIRL #32                      ' Button on P32 as input
  sample1 := INA[32]            ' First reading
  waitms(20)                    ' Debounce delay
  sample2 := INA[32]            ' Second reading
  pressed := sample1 & sample2  ' Both must be pressed
```
:::

#### Parallel Output (8-bit LCD, etc.)

::: spin2
```
PUB output_byte(value)
  DIRH #0 ADDPINS 7             ' P0..P7 as outputs
  OUTA[7..0] := value           ' Write all 8 bits at once
```
:::

#### Simple Bit-Banged Serial (Slow but Educational)

::: spin2
```
PUB send_byte_slow(value) | bit
  DIRH #TX_PIN                  ' TX pin as output
  repeat bit from 0 to 7
    if value & (1 << bit)
      OUTH #TX_PIN              ' Send 1
    else
      OUTL #TX_PIN              ' Send 0
    waitus(104)                 ' ~9600 baud (104us per bit)
```
:::

### 0.6 Multiple Pin Control

The P2 can control multiple pins simultaneously using the ADDPINS operator:

::: spin2
```
PUB control_multiple()
  ' Control 8 LEDs on P16..P23
  DIRH #16 ADDPINS 7            ' Make 8 pins outputs
  OUTH #16 ADDPINS 7            ' Turn all 8 on
  waitms(1000)
  OUTL #16 ADDPINS 7            ' Turn all 8 off
  
  ' Create a pattern
  OUTA[23..16] := %10101010     ' Alternating pattern
```
:::

### 0.7 When Basic I/O Isn't Enough

Basic I/O is perfect for:
- Simple LED control
- Reading buttons and switches
- Slow communication protocols
- Learning and experimentation

But watch what happens when we need precise timing:

::: spin2
```
PUB square_wave_painful()
  ' Try to generate a 1kHz square wave - THE HARD WAY
  DIRH #56
  repeat
    OUTH #56
    waitus(500)                 ' 500us high
    OUTL #56
    waitus(500)                 ' 500us low
    ' Problem: Our cog is 100% busy just toggling one pin!
```
:::

What if you need:
- 10 different square waves at different frequencies?
- PWM for motor control while doing other tasks?
- Precise pulse measurement while running your main program?
- Serial communication without dedicating a cog?

This is where Smart Pins revolutionize everything. Instead of your code toggling pins, you configure dedicated hardware to do it perfectly, forever, without using any processor time.

### 0.8 Transitioning to Smart Pins

Let's see the same 1kHz square wave using a Smart Pin:

::: spin2
```
PUB square_wave_smart()
  ' Configure Smart Pin for square wave - THE SMART WAY
  pinstart(56, P_TRANSITION | P_OE, clkfreq/1000, 0)
  
  ' That's it! Pin 56 now outputs 1kHz forever
  ' Our cog is completely free to do other things
  repeat
    ' Do whatever you want here - the square wave continues!
```
:::

The difference is profound:
- **Basic I/O**: Your code does the work
- **Smart Pins**: Hardware does the work

### 0.9 Quick Reference - Basic I/O Instructions

For your convenience, here's the complete basic I/O instruction set:

| Instruction | Description | Common Use |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **DIRL** #pin | Set pin as input | Reading sensors |
| **DIRH** #pin | Set pin as output | Controlling LEDs |
| **OUTL** #pin | Output low (0) | Turn off LED |
| **OUTH** #pin | Output high (1) | Turn on LED |
| **OUTNOT** #pin | Toggle output | Blink without state |
| **DRVL** #pin | Drive low (output + low) | Combined operation |
| **DRVH** #pin | Drive high (output + high) | Combined operation |
| **FLTL** #pin | Float low (input + out=0) | Tri-state with 0 |
| **FLTH** #pin | Float high (input + out=1) | Tri-state with 1 |

**Reading Pins:**
- `INA[pin]` - Read pins P0-P31
- `INB[pin]` - Read pins P32-P63

**Multiple Pins:**
- Use `ADDPINS n` to control multiple consecutive pins
- Use `OUTA[high..low]` or `OUTB[high..low]` for parallel operations

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: This table covers 90% of your basic I/O needs. The other variants (C, NC, Z, NZ, RND) are in Appendix F for when you need them.

## Chapter 1: The Smart Pin Revolution

[CONTENT FROM v3.0 CONTINUES HERE - Chapter 1 through all existing content remains exactly as in v3.0]

### What Problem Do Smart Pins Solve?

Picture this: You're writing code for a robot. You need to:
- Generate PWM for four motors
- Read two quadrature encoders
- Communicate with sensors via I2C
- Send debug data via serial
- Measure battery voltage with ADC

In a traditional microcontroller, each of these tasks would eat into your processor time. Generating clean PWM at 20kHz? That's an interrupt every 50 microseconds. Reading encoders? More interrupts. Pretty soon, your processor is spending all its time servicing I/O instead of running your robot's logic.

Enter Smart Pins.

### The Smart Pin Concept

Imagine if each I/O pin had its own tiny processor - not a full CPU, but dedicated hardware that could handle one specific task perfectly. That's exactly what Smart Pins are. Each of the P2's 64 I/O pins has a Smart Pin unit that can be configured to perform one of 32 different functions, from simple digital I/O to complex protocols.

![Smart Pin Block Diagram](assets/smart-pins-master-trimmed.png)

Once configured, a Smart Pin runs completely independently. Set up a PWM? It generates perfect pulses forever. Configure a UART? It transmits and receives without bothering your code. Need to count encoder pulses? The Smart Pin counts them in hardware while your code does other things.

### Your First Smart Pin

Let's start with something simple but satisfying - making an LED blink without using any processor time.

::: spin2
```
CON
  _clkfreq = 200_000_000        ' System clock: 200MHz
  LED = 56                      ' P2 Eval board LED

PUB main()
  ' Configure Smart Pin for square wave output
  pinstart(LED, P_TRANSITION | P_OE, clkfreq/2, 0)
  
  ' The LED now blinks at 1Hz forever!
  ' Our code is free to do other things
  repeat
    ' The processor is completely free here
    ' The LED keeps blinking no matter what we do
```
:::

What just happened? Let's break it down:

1. **`P_TRANSITION`** tells the Smart Pin to toggle its output
2. **`P_OE`** enables the output driver (OE = Output Enable)
3. **`clkfreq/2`** sets the transition period (1Hz = 0.5s high + 0.5s low)
4. **`pinstart()`** configures and activates the Smart Pin

The magic? Once that `pinstart()` executes, the LED blinks forever without any further code. No loops, no delays, no interrupts. The Smart Pin handles everything.
