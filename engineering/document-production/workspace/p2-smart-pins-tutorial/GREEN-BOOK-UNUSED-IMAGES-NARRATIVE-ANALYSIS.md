# Green Book Unused Images - Narrative Analysis

**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Purpose**: Check if narrative references exist for unused Titus images

## Analysis Summary

**Finding**: The Green Book narrative does **NOT** contain explicit references to the 8 unused images. The text flows logically without gaps or "see additional diagram" language.

## Detailed Analysis by Unused Image

### 1. `P2 SmartPins-220809_page04_img02.png` (Secondary Config Diagram)
**Current narrative around Configuration Flow (line 234)**:
- Shows single config flow with `page04_img01.png`
- Text flows directly from config steps to Mode Register Structure
- **NO reference** to additional/secondary configuration diagrams
- **NO gap** in narrative flow

**Verdict**: Image available but not referenced in narrative

### 2. `P2 SmartPins-220809_page16_img01.png` (PWM Details)
**Current narrative around PWM section (lines 936-1014)**:
- Shows Sawtooth (line 936) and Triangle (line 1014) waveforms
- Text explains both PWM types completely 
- **NO reference** to additional PWM details or timing diagrams
- **NO gap** between sawtooth and triangle explanations

**Verdict**: Image available but not referenced in narrative

### 3. `P2 SmartPins-220809_page20_img01.png` (Encoder Details)
**Current narrative around Quadrature Encoder (line 1176)**:
- Shows basic encoder signals with `page19_img01.png`
- Text explains A/B quadrature decoding
- **NO reference** to detailed encoder timing or additional diagrams
- **NO gap** in encoder explanation

**Verdict**: Image available but not referenced in narrative

### 4. `P2 SmartPins-220809_page21_img01.png` (Encoder Timing)
**Same section as above - Quadrature Encoder**:
- Single encoder image serves the explanation
- **NO reference** to timing details or additional encoder diagrams
- Flow moves directly to next mode

**Verdict**: Image available but not referenced in narrative

### 5. `P2 SmartPins-220809_page23_img01.png` (Period Measurement)
**Current narrative around State Measurement (line 1557)**:
- Shows measurement modes with `page29_img01.png`  
- **Note**: This unused image (page23) is BEFORE the used image (page29)
- Text doesn't reference earlier/preliminary measurement diagrams
- **NO gap** in measurement mode explanation

**Verdict**: Image available but not referenced in narrative

### 6. `P2 SmartPins-220809_page33_img01.png` (ADC Details)
**Current narrative around ADC section (lines 1742-1826)**:
- Shows SINC2 Filter (line 1742) and Scope Mode (line 1826)
- Text flows from filter response to scope mode
- **NO reference** to additional ADC implementation details
- **NO gap** between ADC explanations

**Verdict**: Image available but not referenced in narrative

### 7. `P2 SmartPins-220809_page46_img02.png` (Serial Details)
**Current narrative around Synchronous Serial (line 2105)**:
- Shows timing diagram with `page46_img01.png`
- Text explains synchronous serial timing completely
- **NO reference** to additional serial details or secondary timing
- **NO gap** in serial explanation

**Verdict**: Image available but not referenced in narrative

### 8. `smart-pins-master-trimmed.png` (Master Overview)
**Current narrative at document beginning**:
- Goes directly into Smart Pin fundamentals
- **NO reference** to comprehensive overview diagram
- **NO "see master diagram"** language

**Verdict**: Image available but not referenced in narrative

## Key Findings

### âœ… Narrative Completeness
- **All sections flow logically** without gaps
- **No "see diagram X"** references to missing images  
- **No placeholder language** like "additional details shown below"
- **Each used image serves its narrative purpose** completely

### ðŸ“Š Pattern Recognition
The unused images represent:
1. **Secondary/supplementary diagrams** (page04_img02, page46_img02)
2. **Intermediate detail level** (page16, page20, page21, page33)  
3. **Earlier page references** (page23 vs used page29)
4. **Comprehensive overviews** (smart-pins-master)

### ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
**The Green Book narrative is INTENTIONALLY COMPLETE** without these images. Opus 4.1 created a tutorial that uses exactly the images it references, with no orphaned references or narrative gaps.

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Leave As-Is (Recommended)
- **Narrative is complete** and flows perfectly
- **14 images provide excellent coverage**
- **No user confusion** from missing references
- **Tutorial focus maintained**

### Option 2: Enhanced Tutorial (Optional)
If wanting richer visual content, could add these unused images by:
- Adding narrative text that references them
- Creating "Advanced Details" sections
- Using them in appendices or "Deep Dive" sidebars

**Current Status**: Green Book is complete and ready for PDF generation without changes.
