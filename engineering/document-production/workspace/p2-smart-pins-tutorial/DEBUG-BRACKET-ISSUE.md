# Debug Analysis - Bracket Issue

## What's in the .tex file:
```latex
\hypertarget{p2-smart-pins-io-complete-tutorial}{%
\part{P2 Smart Pins \& I/O Complete
Tutorial}\label{p2-smart-pins-io-complete-tutorial}}
```

## Structure breakdown:
1. `\hypertarget{p2-smart-pins-io-complete-tutorial}` - starts a hyperlink target
2. `{%` - opens the content block for hypertarget with a comment marker
3. `\part{P2 Smart Pins \& I/O Complete Tutorial}` - the part command with line break
4. `\label{p2-smart-pins-io-complete-tutorial}` - the label
5. `}` - closes the hypertarget content block

## Potential issues:
1. The `\part` command has a line break in the title argument
2. The `\label` is outside the `\part{}` but inside the `\hypertarget{}`
3. The complex nesting might confuse LaTeX processors

## Why our fixes didn't work:
1. The pagination filter fix (skip first header) - The .tex shows NO clearpage was added, so the filter IS working to skip it. But there's still a blank page somehow.
2. The numbering.sty fix (handle optional parameters) - There are NO square brackets in the generated LaTeX, so this isn't the issue.

## The REAL problem might be:
The `\hypertarget{...}{%` wrapper around `\part` might be causing LaTeX to misinterpret the content, especially with the line break in the title.
