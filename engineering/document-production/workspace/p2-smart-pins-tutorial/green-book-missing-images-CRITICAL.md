# CRITICAL: Green Book Has No Images

**Date Discovered**: 2025-08-30
**Document**: P2-Smart-Pins-Green-Book-Tutorial.md
**Status**: BLOCKING ISSUE

## Problem
The Green Book Tutorial generated by Opus 4.1 contains **ZERO images**. Verification shows:
- 0 image references in the entire 2,821 line document
- No `![...]()` markdown image syntax found
- No references to the `assets/` directory

## Why This Is Critical
1. **Tutorial documents require visual aids** for effective learning
2. **Smart Pins are inherently visual** - timing diagrams, signal flows, pin configurations
3. **The Blue Book (Reference) has images** - the tutorial should have even more
4. **User experience severely impacted** - text-only hardware tutorial is inadequate

## Images That Should Be Present
Based on the Blue Book, at minimum these images should be referenced:
- Smart Pin block diagram
- Pin numbering diagram  
- Signal flow diagrams for each mode
- Timing diagrams for synchronous modes
- Configuration register layouts
- Example waveforms

## Recommended Action
**Generate a new Green Book master** with instructions to:
1. Include image references at appropriate points
2. Use markdown syntax: `![Description](assets/filename.png)`
3. Reference existing Blue Book images where applicable
4. Add placeholders for tutorial-specific diagrams

## Temporary Workaround
Could manually add image references, but this would be:
- Time-consuming (32 modes Ã— multiple images each)
- Error-prone (might miss critical diagrams)
- Not matching the AI's pedagogical flow

## Decision Required
Should we:
1. Regenerate the entire Green Book with image instructions?
2. Manually add image references to existing text?
3. Proceed without images for now (NOT recommended)?

**Recommendation**: Regenerate with explicit image instructions to Opus 4.1
