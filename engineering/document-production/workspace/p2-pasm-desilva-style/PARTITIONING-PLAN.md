## Optimal Partitioning Strategy

### Goal: ~12-15KB per part for comfortable editing

### Recommended Parts (Based on Content Density):

#### Part 1: Getting Started (Lines 1-441, ~17KB)
- Front Matter (Copyright, License, Dedication, Acknowledgments, Preface)
- Chapter 1: Your First Spin (full chapter with examples)

#### Part 2: Architecture (Lines 442-842, ~16KB)
- Chapter 2: Architecture Safari (full chapter, very detailed)

#### Part 3: Programming (Lines 843-1359, ~21KB)
- Chapter 3: Speaking PASM2 (full chapter, instruction details)
- Chapter 4: The Hub Connection (full chapter)

#### Part 4: Mathematics & Control (Lines 1360-1550, ~8KB)
- Chapter 5: Mathematics Unleashed
- Chapter 6: Flags and Decisions
- Chapter 7: CORDIC Magic
- Chapter 8: Smart Pins Symphony (start)

#### Part 5: I/O & Optimization (Lines 1551-1805, ~10KB)
- Chapter 8: Smart Pins Symphony (rest)
- Chapter 9: Streaming Data
- Chapter 10: Hub Execution
- Chapter 11: Interrupts (If You Must)
- Chapter 12: Optimization Mastery

#### Part 6: Applications (Lines 1806-2030, ~9KB)
- Chapter 13: Video Generation
- Chapter 14: Serial Protocols
- Chapter 15: Signal Processing
- Chapter 16: Multi-COG Orchestration

#### Part 7: Reference (Lines 2031-2194, ~4KB)
- Appendix A: Instruction Set Reference
- Index

## Why This Distribution

1. **Part 1 & 2** are the detailed, rich content (need most work)
2. **Part 3 & 4** are summaries that need expansion later
3. **Part 5** is reference material, separate concern
4. Each part is manageable size (4-20KB)
5. Natural content boundaries preserved

## Benefits

- No file exceeds 20KB (comfortable for editing)
- Natural chapter boundaries mostly preserved
- Front-heavy content (Ch 1-3) split reasonably
- Summary chapters grouped together
- Reference material isolated
