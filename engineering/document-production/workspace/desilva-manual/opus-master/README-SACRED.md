# ðŸ”´ SACRED MASTER DOCUMENT - DO NOT MODIFY ðŸ”´

## This Directory Contains the Opus-Generated Master

**File**: `COMPLETE-OPUS-MASTER.md`
**Generated**: August 20, 2025
**Size**: 61,198 bytes
**Model**: Claude Opus 4.1
**Status**: READ-ONLY (chmod 444)

## What This Is

This is the complete 16-chapter De Silva style P2 Assembly manual generated by Opus. It includes:
- Full front matter (dedication, acknowledgments, preface)
- All 16 chapters of content
- Appendices
- Index

## Why This Is Sacred

1. **Opus Time is Expensive** - This represents significant Opus 4.1 generation time
2. **Cannot Be Regenerated** - The exact prompt context is lost
3. **Source of Truth** - All Part 1, Part 2, etc. are derived from this
4. **Nearly Lost** - Found in archive-old folder on Aug 22, 2025

## How to Use

1. **NEVER EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY**
2. Extract sections to `parts-extracted/` for editing
3. Work on copies in `editing/`
4. Process copies through to `ready/` then `outbound/`

## Recovery Note

On August 22, 2025, we almost lost this master. It was hiding in:
`/exports/pdf-generation/outbound/pasm2-manual-v1/archive-old/document.md`

We found it by:
1. Checking context keys for clues
2. Following file size (61KB) 
3. Verifying content against edited Part 1

**Lesson**: Always protect your masters immediately after generation!

## Protection Status

```bash
-r--r--r--  COMPLETE-OPUS-MASTER.md
```

File is READ-ONLY to prevent accidental modification.

To extract parts for editing:
```bash
# Copy, never move!
cp COMPLETE-OPUS-MASTER.md ../parts-extracted/Part1-EXTRACTED.md
```
