## Understanding Claude Code in Your Development Workflow

### What Claude Code Is

Claude Code is an AI-powered development assistant that helps you:
- Write and debug Spin2 and PASM2 code
- Understand P2 architecture and capabilities
- Solve complex embedded programming challenges
- Generate boilerplate code and templates
- Explain instruction behaviors and timing

### What Claude Code Isn't

- **Not a data collector** - It doesn't harvest your code for training
- **Not a telemetry system** - No usage tracking or analytics
- **Not connected to other users** - Your sessions are isolated
- **Not a permanent storage** - Conversations aren't archived indefinitely

---

## Your Code, Your Privacy

### How Your Code Stays Yours

**Session Isolation**
- Each Claude Code session is independent
- Your code isn't visible to other developers
- No cross-contamination between projects
- Clean slate with each new conversation

**Training on Your Data - You Choose**
- **Default**: Claude doesn't learn from your conversations
- **Opt-in Available**: You can choose to help improve Claude by allowing training
- **Your Control**: This is entirely your decision
- **Proprietary Protection**: Most developers keep this OFF for commercial work
- **Open Source**: Consider opting IN when working on public projects

**Temporary Processing Only**
- Code is processed only during active sessions
- No long-term storage of your implementations
- Conversations expire and are deleted
- No permanent record of your development process

### Best Practices for Code Privacy

**1. Sanitize Sensitive Information**
```spin2
' Instead of this:
API_KEY = "sk-proj-abc123xyz789"  ' Company API key

' Do this:
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"     ' Replace with actual key
```

**2. Abstract Proprietary Logic**
```spin2
' Instead of sharing your secret sauce:
PRI calculateProprietaryFilter(input) : output
  ' [200 lines of proprietary DSP code]
  
' Share the interface and problem:
PRI calculateProprietaryFilter(input) : output
  ' Need help optimizing this DSP routine
  ' Input: 16-bit samples at 48kHz
  ' Output: Filtered signal
  ' Current execution: 850 cycles, need < 600
```

**3. Use Generic Examples**
- Replace company-specific constants with generic values
- Substitute real product names with descriptive placeholders
- Remove customer-specific requirements from queries
- Focus on technical challenges, not business logic

---

## Smart Strategies for AI-Assisted Development

### Protecting Intellectual Property

**Compartmentalize Your Queries**
- Break complex systems into generic components
- Ask about patterns, not implementations
- Focus on public algorithms and techniques
- Keep system architecture discussions high-level

**Example: Safe vs. Risky Queries**

✅ **Safe Query:**
"How can I implement I2C communication on P2 Smart Pins?"

❌ **Risky Query:**
"Here's my complete motor control system for our new drone product..."

✅ **Safe Query:**
"What's the most efficient way to implement a FIR filter in PASM2?"

❌ **Risky Query:**
"This is our proprietary sensor fusion algorithm that gives us market advantage..."

### Working with Confidential Projects

**The Air-Gap Approach**
1. Develop core proprietary logic offline
2. Use Claude Code for generic helper functions
3. Integrate components in your private environment
4. Test complete system without AI assistance

**The Abstraction Method**
1. Create interfaces and stubs for sensitive components
2. Get AI help with non-critical surrounding code
3. Implement secret sauce privately
4. Maintain clear boundaries between public and private code

## Data Security Best Practices

### Before You Start Coding

**Environment Setup**
- [ ] Review your company's AI usage policies
- [ ] Understand what code can be shared
- [ ] Set up local backups of all work
- [ ] Create clear project boundaries
- [ ] Document what's shareable vs. confidential

**Project Planning**
- [ ] Identify proprietary components early
- [ ] Plan which parts need AI assistance
- [ ] Prepare sanitized test cases
- [ ] Create generic examples for testing
- [ ] Establish code review procedures

### During Development

**Safe Sharing Practices**

```spin2
' ✅ GOOD: Generic timing question
"How do I ensure this PASM2 loop executes in exactly 16 cycles?"

' ❌ BAD: Revealing proprietary timing
"Our product requires 16.384MHz sampling for patent #123456"

' ✅ GOOD: Abstract the problem
"I need to read 8 sensors sequentially within 100µs"

' ❌ BAD: Expose the application
"Our medical device monitors these specific biomarkers..."
```

**Code Review Checklist**
Before sharing code with Claude Code:
- [ ] Remove all API keys and credentials
- [ ] Strip out customer or company names
- [ ] Delete proprietary comments
- [ ] Replace magic numbers with generic values
- [ ] Verify no NDA-covered information remains

### After Development Sessions

**Session Hygiene**
1. Export important code to your local system
2. Clear conversation history when switching projects
3. Don't rely on Claude Code for code storage
4. Maintain your own version control
5. Document learnings in your private notes

## Understanding AI Limitations and Risks

### Technical Limitations

**Claude Code Cannot:**
- Access your local file system directly
- See other conversations or sessions
- Remember previous projects after clearing
- Share your code with other users
- Train itself on your implementations (unless you opt in)
- Use your code for training without permission

**You Are Responsible For:**
- Verifying all generated code
- Testing on actual P2 hardware
- Maintaining security of your systems
- Protecting proprietary information
- Complying with company policies

### Privacy Considerations

**What Anthropic Can See**
- Aggregated usage statistics (not your code)
- System performance metrics
- Error reports and crashes
- General feature usage patterns

**What Anthropic Cannot Use (Default Settings)**
- Your conversations for training (unless you opt in)
- Your specific implementations to train future models
- Your code to improve Claude (without your permission)

**What Remains Private (Even with Opt-in)**
- Other users never see your code
- Your sessions remain isolated
- Your competitive advantage stays yours
- Direct customer data should never be shared

## Practical Scenarios and Solutions

### Scenario 1: Debug Helper Pattern

**Need:** Help debugging a complex Smart Pin configuration

**Safe Approach:**
```spin2
' Share the problematic configuration
wrpin(P_SYNC_TX | P_OE, pin)
wxpin($1_0000 | (8-1), pin)
wypin(0, pin)
' Ask: "Why isn't this UART transmitting?"
```

**What NOT to Do:**
```spin2
' Don't share the entire proprietary communication protocol
' Don't reveal what device you're interfacing with
' Don't include customer-specific baud rates
```

### Scenario 2: Algorithm Optimization

**Need:** Optimize a control loop for speed

**Safe Approach:**
- Share the mathematical operation needed
- Provide generic timing constraints
- Ask about PASM2 optimization techniques
- Focus on instruction-level improvements

**Protected Elements:**

- Don't reveal system dynamics
- Hide application-specific constants
- Protect tuning values

### Scenario 3: Learning New Features

**Need:** Understand CORDIC engine operations

**Safe Approach:**
```spin2
' Ask about generic CORDIC operations
"How do I use QROTATE for coordinate transformation?"
"What's the precision of QSIN/QCOS functions?"
"Can you show a generic FFT using CORDIC?"
```

**Maintain Privacy:**
- Don't reveal signal processing applications
- Keep frequency ranges generic
- Hide specific accuracy requirements
- Protect domain-specific uses
