## 🔗 Integration with Existing Systems

### **Consumer Registry Integration** (From Image Extraction)
**Primary Pattern Extraction** owns patterns, specialized extractions reference:
```
/sources/extractions/[source-code-analysis]/
├── patterns/
│   ├── best-practices-[date]/
│   ├── antipatterns-[date]/
│   └── p2-optimizations-[date]/
├── PATTERN-CONSUMERS.md
└── [analysis].md

# Consumer Registry Example:
## Secondary Extractions (Immediate Updates)
- `/p2-claude-knowledge/instruction-knowledge/` → Multi-COG patterns
- `/p2-claude-knowledge/optimization-patterns/` → Performance patterns

## Documents (Technical Debt Queue)  
- `/documentation/manuals/da-silva-p2-manual.md` → Available: 15 new patterns
- `/ai-reference/programming-patterns.md` → Available: 8 antipattern alternatives
```

### **Technical Debt Integration** (From Visual Assets)
```markdown
## Source Code Pattern Integration Available:
- **Available**: 23 validated programming patterns from flash file system
- **Enhancement Value**: +40% AI code generation accuracy
- **Integration Effort**: Medium-High (6-8 hours pattern documentation)
- **Priority**: High (foundational patterns for P2 development)
```

- ❌ **No consumer awareness** or update propagation
- ❌ **No systematic quality gates** like other P2 processes

### **Critical Success Factor**: **Systematic consistency across all ingestion types**
- All P2 ingestion processes share common elements: validation, trust levels, integration planning
- Source code ingestion should follow same systematic approach
- Consumer registry and technical debt integration are essential for knowledge base scalability

### **Enhanced Value Proposition**:
- **From**: Analyze code and extract patterns
- **To**: Comprehensive audit with validated patterns, integration roadmap, and systematic knowledge base enhancement
