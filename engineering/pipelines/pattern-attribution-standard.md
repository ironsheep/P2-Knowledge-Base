# Pattern Attribution Standard

**Purpose**: Ensure every extracted pattern maintains complete source lineage and attribution for traceability, validation, and legal compliance.

## Required Attribution Header

Every pattern file must include this header structure:

```markdown
# [Pattern Name]

**Source**: [Original Source Title and Version]  
**Extract Date**: [Date pattern was extracted]  
**Authority Level**: [Authority assessment - Maximum/High/Medium/Low]  
**License**: [License terms and requirements]  
**Original File**: [Specific file and location references]  
**Analysis**: [Analysis methodology used]  
```

## Attribution Examples

### Maximum Authority Example:
```markdown
# Multi-COG Coordination Pattern

**Source**: Chip Gracey Flash File System v2.0.0  
**Extract Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Authority Level**: Maximum (P2 Designer)  
**License**: P2 Community Standard  
**Original File**: flash_fs.spin2, lines ~450-480 (lock acquisition pattern)  
**Analysis**: Enhanced Source Code Ingestion v2.0  
```

### Community Source Example:
```markdown
# Serial Communication Pattern

**Source**: Community Multi-COG Serial Library v1.3  
**Extract Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Authority Level**: High (Community Validated)  
**License**: MIT License  
**Original File**: serial_cog.spin2, method startSerial()  
**Analysis**: Enhanced Source Code Ingestion v2.0  
```

## Authority Level Guidelines

### **Maximum Authority**
- **Source**: P2 designer (Chip Gracey) or Parallax official
- **Validation**: Production-tested, officially endorsed
- **Trust**: Highest possible confidence
- **Usage**: Reference implementation standard

### **High Authority** 
- **Source**: Experienced P2 community developers
- **Validation**: Community-tested, widely adopted
- **Trust**: High confidence with verification
- **Usage**: Recommended patterns with validation

### **Medium Authority**
- **Source**: Competent developers, limited validation
- **Validation**: Some testing, moderate adoption
- **Trust**: Moderate confidence, requires verification
- **Usage**: Consider with additional validation

### **Low Authority**
- **Source**: Experimental, unproven, or tutorial code
- **Validation**: Minimal or no production testing
- **Trust**: Low confidence, educational only
- **Usage**: Learning examples, not production patterns

## Legal & License Tracking

### **License Types Common in P2 Community**
- **P2 Community Standard**: Typical open sharing with attribution
- **MIT License**: Permissive with attribution requirement
- **Apache 2.0**: Permissive with patent protection
- **GPL**: Copyleft requirements
- **Public Domain**: No restrictions
- **Custom/Proprietary**: Specific terms from author

### **Attribution Requirements**
- **Always Required**: Credit to original author(s)
- **License Compliance**: Follow specific license terms
- **Commercial Use**: Check license for commercial restrictions
- **Modification Rights**: Understand modification permissions
- **Distribution**: Follow redistribution requirements

## Source Context Documentation

Every pattern must include source context section:

```markdown
## Source Context

**Original Implementation**: [What the pattern was used for originally]  
**Author Authority**: [Why this source is trustworthy]  
**Validation**: [How pattern has been tested/proven]  
**Community Status**: [Adoption and acceptance level]  
**Real-World Usage**: [Production applications using this pattern]  

**Design Rationale**: [Why pattern was chosen for original use]
```

## Traceability Requirements

### **Source File References**
- **Specific Location**: File name and line numbers where possible
- **Method/Function**: Specific code sections containing pattern
- **Version Information**: Source code version or date
- **Context**: Surrounding code that provides pattern context

### **Analysis Traceability**
- **Extraction Method**: How pattern was identified and extracted
- **Analysis Date**: When analysis was performed
- **Analyst**: Who performed the analysis (AI, human, team)
- **Methodology**: Analysis framework used

### **Update Tracking**
- **Source Monitoring**: How to check for source updates
- **Change Detection**: Process for identifying pattern changes
- **Impact Assessment**: How to evaluate change impacts
- **Consumer Notification**: How to alert pattern users of changes

## Integration with Enhanced Methodology

### **Phase 6: Source Archival & Attribution**
Attribution standard integrates with archival phase:
- **Complete Attribution**: Full source lineage documentation
- **Legal Compliance**: License terms and requirements verified
- **Traceability**: Source-to-pattern linkage maintained
- **Update Strategy**: Source monitoring and change detection

### **Quality Gates Integration**
Attribution requirements included in 14-point audit:
- **Source Attribution Verification**: Complete and accurate attribution
- **Legal Compliance Check**: License terms properly documented
- **Authority Assessment**: Authority level appropriate for source
- **Traceability Validation**: Source-to-pattern links verified
