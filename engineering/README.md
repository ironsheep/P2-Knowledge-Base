# Engineering — Heads Board (front door)

> The **operational map** of the P2-Knowledge-Base engineering effort: the *heads*
> (independent work-fronts under one repo), each head's status at a glance, and
> **the next actionable thing in each**. Per-head detail lives in that head's own
> dashboard — this board links out, it does not duplicate.
>
> **This is the static map. `whats-next` is the guided entry.** Run the
> `whats-next` skill at session start — it reads the `active_element` pointer,
> resumes your thread, and routes you into the right head. This README is what you
> read to see the *whole board* and decide where to push next.

## The heads — status & next action

Glance only — one line per head; each head's own dashboard (Dashboard column) holds the detail.

| Head | Dashboard | Status at a glance | Next actionable |
|------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Ingestion** | [`ingestion/README.md`](ingestion/README.md) | **36 logical sources** (🏆 26) · gap ledger 6 OPEN + 4 PARTIAL · expert queue 6 open | **next target is open** — the prior entry (Smart Pins cert audit) closed 2026-08-26 |
| **YAML (P2KB)** | [dashboard](operations/YAML-HEAD-DASHBOARD.md) · [register](operations/P2KB-CORRECTION-FINDINGS.md) | **v1.18.0** shipped 2026-09-09 — cite-or-omit as policy; findability treated as a defect class (dark files 452 → 173) | Next correction/enrichment as findings land |
| **Manual** | [`document-production/README.md`](document-production/README.md) · [roster](document-production/PUBLICATION-ROSTER.md) | **18 published** · 9 manuals · 7 app-notes · 1 guide · 1 tool-guide — latest **Single-Step Debugger v1.0.0** + **PNut-Term-TS v1.0.0**, both 2026-09-10 | **v1.18.0 wave staged** — 8 documents in outbound; build shortest-first, Assembly last |
| **OBEX** | [`obex-integration/README.md`](obex-integration/README.md) | ✅ **v2.2** (2026-06-29) · **130 P2 objects** · shipped in KB v1.13.3 · MCP-served | Delta re-scan vs the **2026-06-29** baseline |
| **Operations** | [`operations/README.md`](operations/README.md) | Cross-cutting process · owns register + lessons-learned | (infrastructure — supports the content heads) |
| **Quick Bytes** | [`quickbytes-integration/README.md`](quickbytes-integration/README.md) | 🔴 NOT processed · ~15% discovered | Parked — not moving soon (tracked so it isn't lost) |

## How the heads work (the model)
- **~70% of work is single-head run-to-completion; ~30% interleaved** — progress a head, set it aside,
  pick another, sometimes return. The only state we actively store is one pointer: the todo-mcp context
  key `active_element` (`head:element`). Everything else is reconstructed from these dashboards + git.
- **Each head has a working skill** (its execution counterpart): ingestion → `ingest-source`;
  manual → `prepare-manual` / `release-manual`; yaml → `yaml-knowledge-base-maintenance`;
  obex/quickbytes → their integration pipelines.
- **Trust chain (sacred):** Trusted Sources → Trusted YAML → Trusted Documentation → Community.
  Every head preserves fidelity along this chain.

  *(separate concern — the GitHub-facing pitch, not this operational board)*

---
*This board is the operational front door. Keep each row's "status / next" honest and current — a stale
board is worse than none. Detail belongs in the per-head dashboards; this stays glanceable.*
