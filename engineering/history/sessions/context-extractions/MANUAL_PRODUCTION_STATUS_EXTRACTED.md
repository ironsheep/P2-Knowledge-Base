## Content Flagging System
3-tier content flag system:
- **Violet** (missing content)
- **Orange** (review needed) 
- **Blue** (diagram needed)
Goal: ALL colors disappear when ready. Simple completion metric.

## Tech Review Approach
- `[TECH REVIEW: specific question]` for missing details
- `[VERIFY: assumption]` for unconfirmed specs
- `[NEED EXAMPLE: what's missing]` for code gaps
- `[TIMING: measurement needed]` for performance claims
Include working code, mark uncertainties clearly. Each chapter complete with exercises.
