# Session End Backup - 2025-08-25

## Todo List Export
See: `/tasks/backups/project_dump_20250825_235856.json`

## Critical Context for Tomorrow's Resume

### RESUME PLAN:
1. **Structure Understanding First** - Review workspace vs outbound workflow
2. **Investigate Escaping Problem** - Image paths with spaces getting corrupted (NEW issue)
3. **Fix Template Typo** - shobtabs → showtabs in p2kb-foundation.sty  
4. **Test Full Stack** - workspace → escape → outbound → PDF generation
5. **Clean Workspace** - Move 8+ dated backups to .backups/ subdirectory

### VERIFIED WORKING STRUCTURE:
- **Source**: `workspace/smart-pins-manual/opus-master/COMPLETE-OPUS-MASTER.md` (read-only)
- **Working**: `workspace/smart-pins-manual/P2-Smart-Pins-Complete-Reference-WORKING.md` (processed)  
- **Delivery**: `outbound/P2-Smart-Pins-Reference/` (escaped versions)

### NEW PROBLEMS DISCOVERED:
- **Escaping Corruption**: Image paths with spaces becoming `\textbackslash\{\}` garbage
- **Template Typo**: `shobtabs` should be `showtabs` in listings config
- **pandoc_args**: Need to be at document level, not top level in request.json

### COMPLETED TODAY:
- ✅ Template numbering fixes (secnumdepth, page breaks, part/chapter logic)
- ✅ Workspace structure corrected (opus-master moved to right location)
- ✅ Working copy has fixed asset paths and manual TOC removed
- ✅ Process workflow understanding clarified

### STATUS: 
Ready for final push tomorrow with shorter initial context for more working headroom.
