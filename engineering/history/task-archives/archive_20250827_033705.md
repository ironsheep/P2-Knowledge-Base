### Task #1097
**Content:** Investigate list rendering issues by finding examples and testing markdown fixes. Locate 2-3 problematic lists in Smart Pins WORKING.md that currently render as 'one long continuous sentence with hyphens between sentences' instead of proper formatted lists. For each example: (1) document current markdown syntax, (2) apply best-practice markdown list formatting (proper spacing, indentation, blank lines), (3) mark these as test cases for PDF generation. Goal is to determine if issue is markdown syntax problems or Pandoc/template rendering issues requiring style sheet intervention. This sets up A/B testing in single PDF with modified vs unmodified lists.

### Task #1096
**Content:** Remove mini table of contents from Smart Pins workspace WORKING.md file to clean document for processing. Locate and delete the small table of contents section that appears in the Opus master document - this is standard cleanup we do every time we start processing a new document from Opus output. Search for 'table of contents' or similar heading and remove entire section including any associated markdown list structure. Verify document integrity after removal. File location: /exports/pdf-generation/workspace/smart-pins-manual/P2-Smart-Pins-Complete-Reference-WORKING.md

### Task #1095
**Content:** Validate LaTeX escaping script regression test suite to confirm baseline functionality. Run the existing test-runner.sh in tools/latex-escaping-regression/ to verify all regression tests pass with current script version. This confirms that recent image path corruption issues (spaces becoming %20 and extra backslashes) are new edge cases requiring script enhancement, not fundamental script breakage. Document results and any failures. Critical to establish that our foundation tool works before building on it for Smart Pins processing.

### Task #1094
**Content:** Research and document automated testing system for PDF generation workflow. Hunt through existing documentation, context keys, and workspace structure to find all information about the shared-test system, monitoring scripts, and automated PDF validation. Create tiny focused reference document at /documentation/work-mode-guides/automated-pdf-testing.md with complete usage instructions including: how to start/stop the forge listener, create test requests, monitor results via JSON files, interpret success/failure. Save context key pointing to this document for future sessions. This enables rapid iteration during visual refinement work instead of slow manual PDF generation cycles.

### Task #1093
**Content:** Resume current Smart Pins visual refinement work - check workspace and address recent escaping issues

### Task #1105
**Content:** Create 3 colored tcolorbox environments in p2kb-smart-pins-content.sty template. Design Configuration (light blue pastel), Spin2 (green), and PASM2 (De Silva yellow) code block environments using tcolorbox package. Ensure consistent styling, proper spacing, and page-break compatibility while maintaining the existing Smart Pins template architecture.

### Task #1104
**Content:** Find and extract color definitions from De Silva template. Extract the proven yellow color used for PASM code blocks in De Silva enhanced template, and define complementary light blue (pastel) and green colors for Configuration and Spin2 blocks. Document the color values for consistent use across the Smart Pins template system.

### Task #1098
**Content:** Generate first test PDF to evaluate current document state and list rendering effectiveness. Use either automated testing system (if available) or manual PDF forge process to create PDF from current Smart Pins workspace WORKING.md with mini TOC removed and 2-3 test list fixes applied. Review results to determine: (1) do modified lists render better than unmodified ones, (2) overall document visual quality assessment, (3) identify any new issues introduced. This provides visual feedback loop for next iteration of improvements and validates our list fix approach before scaling up.

### Task #1100
**Content:** Design and implement code block coloring system for Configuration/Spin2/PASM2 differentiation. Each Smart Pins chapter contains three sequential code blocks (Configuration, Spin2, PASM2) that need visual differentiation while remaining as code blocks. Research and implement paired Markdown + template solution: (1) add distinguishing classes/attributes to markdown code blocks, (2) create corresponding template styling to render each type with different background colors or borders, (3) test that syntax highlighting still works correctly, (4) ensure changes don't break existing code block functionality. Requires coordinated changes to both markdown source and LaTeX template files.
