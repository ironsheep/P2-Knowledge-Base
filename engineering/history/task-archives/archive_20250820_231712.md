### Task #933
**Content:** **[Model: Opus 4.1 Required]** Create the P2 manual creation guide based on DeSilva analysis and P1â†’P2 mapping. Using the voice analysis from `/sources/extractions/desilva-p1-tutorial/voice-analysis.md` and content map, create a comprehensive guide at `/documentation/manuals/pasm2-manual/creation-guide.md`. The guide must include: (1) specific voice directive referencing the DeSilva analysis location, (2) pedagogical improvements identified during analysis, (3) complete mapping of P1 sections that transfer to P2 with modifications needed, (4) comprehensive checklist of all P2 features that need coverage (all 400+ instructions, Smart Pins, CORDIC, etc.), (5) document structure recommendations, (6) teaching progression and example strategies. Create sections that can transfer directly from P1 approach where concepts are similar, and identify P2-unique features requiring new explanatory frameworks. This guide becomes the blueprint for creating high-quality P2 documentation in DeSilva's effective teaching style. Deliverable: Complete manual creation guide ready for use by future documentation efforts.
