### Task #1161
**Content:** Interactive planning session for Green Book visual design decisions. Review and discuss three key areas before implementation: (1) Color Strategy - compare bold colors for quick scanning (reference style) vs softer colors for extended reading (tutorial style), determine distinct palette for gap markers. (2) Typography Adjustments - evaluate larger body text (11pt to 11.5pt), increased line spacing for readability, different fonts for exercises/activities. (3) Page Layout - consider wider margins for reader notes, chapter thumb indices feasibility, progress indicators throughout document. Document decisions for each area and create implementation plan. This is a discussion checkpoint, not implementation.

### Task #1163
**Content:** Implement template updates for tutorial-specific formatting based on design decisions. Add or modify environments in p2kb-smart-pins-content.sty for exercises (with 'Try This' variations), progressive complexity indicators, cross-reference callouts, and any other tutorial elements identified during planning session. Ensure visual hierarchy supports learning progression. Test that all environments compile without LaTeX errors. Consider adding conditional logic to detect book-type variable and apply different styling accordingly.

### Task #1164
**Content:** Verify and test complete Green Book PDF generation pipeline. Check all components are in place: escaped markdown in workspace, all Lua filters present and functional, updated .sty files with new environments, request.json properly configured. Run test compilation locally if possible or prepare complete package for PDF Forge deployment. Document any errors or warnings encountered. Create checklist of files to deploy: escaped .md file, request.json, any modified .sty files, new Lua filters. Ensure image assets are available. This is the final validation before user deploys to PDF Forge.
