### Task #929
**Content:** Create the instruction completion matrix directory and initial structure at `/sources/pasm2-master/completion-matrix.md`. Review ALL question files from previous ingestions including `/sources/extractions/qa-spreadsheet-extraction.md`, `/sources/extractions/pasm2-manual-complete-extraction-audit.md`, `/sources/extractions/hardware-manual-complete-extraction-audit.md`, and any other files containing questions about PASM2 instructions (search the extractions directory for files containing "question" or "?"). Extract every instruction-related question with its source file and line number. Create a structured matrix showing: Question Text, Related Instruction(s), Source Document, Line Reference, Status (Answered/Unanswered), Answer (if known), Answer Source. Include a section for tracking completeness from two perspectives: source perspective (did we get everything from each document?) and instruction perspective (what's missing for each instruction?). Format as markdown with clear sections and maintain source attribution for future back-annotation. Deliverable: Complete instruction completion matrix at `/sources/pasm2-master/completion-matrix.md`.

### Task #928
**Content:** Create the foundational PASM2 master instruction table at `/sources/pasm2-master/instruction-table.md`. First, create the directory structure if it doesn't exist. Initialize the table by extracting all 400+ instruction names from the CSV data at `/sources/extractions/csv-pasm2-instructions-v2.md` (verify this file exists first). Create a comprehensive markdown table with columns: Instruction Name, Opcode, Meta Group, Clock Cycles, Flag Effects (C/Z/both/none), Category, Description Status, Missing Info. For each instruction, populate any known data from the CSV extraction and mark all unknown fields explicitly as "MISSING: [field name]". Include a detailed header explaining the table's purpose, update methodology, and how to interpret the MISSING markers. Format as a clean markdown table with consistent column widths. This becomes the single source of truth for all PASM2 instruction knowledge. Validate that all instructions from the CSV are included and no duplicates exist. Deliverable: Complete master instruction table with explicit gap tracking at `/sources/pasm2-master/instruction-table.md`.

### Task #936
**Content:** Perform cross-ingestion reconciliation to answer previously unanswered questions using newer ingestion data. Review the completion matrix at `/sources/pasm2-master/completion-matrix.md` and identify all unanswered questions from earlier ingestions. Systematically check if any newer extraction documents contain answers to these questions by searching through files like `/sources/extractions/spin2-v51-complete-extraction-audit.md`, `/sources/extractions/hardware-manual-complete-extraction-audit.md`, and other recent extractions. For each question that can now be answered: (1) document the answer with complete citation including source file and line number, (2) update the completion matrix with answer and source, (3) add to back-annotation list for updating original source documents. Create a summary report at `/.sprints/accessibility-discovery-sprint-005/questions-answered.md` showing which questions were resolved, what sources provided answers, and the impact on our knowledge completeness. This retroactive improvement demonstrates the value of systematic consolidation. Deliverable: Updated completion matrix and questions-answered summary report.

### Task #935
**Content:** Conduct comprehensive audit of existing ingestion sources to identify where code examples and images should have been extracted but weren't. Review all files in `/sources/extractions/` and identify extraction documents that contain embedded code examples or reference images but don't have organized `code-examples/` or `images/` subdirectories. Create a gap analysis document at `/sources/extractions/retroactive-extraction-gaps.md` listing: (1) which source files contain unextracted examples/images, (2) estimated count of items per file, (3) types of examples (instruction demos, complete programs, code snippets, diagrams), (4) priority for future extraction based on value to P2 developers. This audit ensures consistency across all our ingestion work and identifies opportunities to improve existing extractions using our new methodology. Create tasks list for future sprints to address these gaps. Deliverable: Complete gap analysis and future work recommendations at `/sources/extractions/retroactive-extraction-gaps.md`.

### Task #931
**Content:** Extract text from the DeSilva P1 Assembly Tutorial PDF using pdftotext. First, locate the PDF file - check `/sources/originals/` directory and `/import/` directory for files containing "desilva", "assembly", or "tutorial" in the name. Verify the file exists and check its size before processing (use appropriate technique to avoid crashes). Run `pdftotext [filepath] /sources/extractions/desilva-p1-tutorial/extracted-text.md` to extract the content. Create the extraction directory structure at `/sources/extractions/desilva-p1-tutorial/` and organize extracted content. Review the extracted text for quality - ensure it's readable and properly formatted. Create a content map identifying what P1 aspects are covered: which instructions, concepts, architectural features, programming patterns, and teaching approaches are discussed. Save this analysis as `/sources/extractions/desilva-p1-tutorial/content-map.md`. This extraction provides the foundation for voice analysis and P1 reference creation. Deliverable: Extracted text and content map at `/sources/extractions/desilva-p1-tutorial/`.

### Task #930
**Content:** Extract and organize the 550+ code examples from all audit documents in the `/sources/extractions/` directory. Begin by identifying files containing code examples - specifically check `/sources/extractions/spin2-v51-complete-extraction-audit.md` (which has 267 Spin2 examples) and other extraction files for embedded code blocks. For each code example found, extract: (1) the complete code block, (2) the section heading it appears under, (3) any descriptive text within 5 lines before/after the code, (4) the exact line number reference, (5) what instruction or concept it demonstrates. Create organized folders following the pattern `/sources/extractions/[source-file]/code-examples/[category]/example-[number].[extension]`. Use soft categorization (don't overthink) - group by instruction type, concept, or purpose as best judgment allows. Create metadata files alongside each example with source attribution, description, and context. Focus only on P2/PASM2/Spin2 examples, keep P1 examples separate if found. Validate examples are syntactically reasonable (not just random text). Deliverable: Organized code example folders with metadata for all 550+ examples under their respective source extraction directories.

### Task #937
**Content:** Create the final audit bundle consolidating all sprint findings and knowledge state improvements. Generate a comprehensive status report at `/.sprints/accessibility-discovery-sprint-005/audit-summary.md` including: (1) coverage metrics - percentage of instructions with complete information before/after sprint, (2) questions answered count with source attribution, (3) gaps identified and prioritized for future work, (4) code examples cataloged by category and source, (5) progress metrics showing knowledge state improvement. Update the Operations Dashboard at `/OPERATIONS-DASHBOARD.md` with current state reflecting sprint outcomes. Create a master list of all remaining outstanding questions organized by priority and likelihood of resolution. Include recommendations for next steps and areas requiring external input or additional sources. This document becomes the definitive record of Sprint 005's impact on our P2 knowledge base and guides future development priorities. Deliverable: Complete audit summary and updated operations dashboard.

### Task #934
**Content:** Create the P1 master instruction reference structure parallel to P2 at `/sources/p1-master/`. Using content extracted from DeSilva tutorial at `/sources/extractions/desilva-p1-tutorial/`, create `instruction-table.md` and `completion-matrix.md` following the same structure as the P2 master table. Extract all P1 instruction references from the DeSilva content and organize them with available attributes (opcodes, flags, timing where mentioned). Mark this as preliminary reference based on DeSilva content only, noting that formal P1 documentation is needed for complete coverage. Include explicit limitations stating this covers only what DeSilva tutorial provides and is intended for P1â†”P2 comparison purposes. Create completion matrix tracking what P1 knowledge we have versus what we need for full comparison capability. This establishes the foundation for P1 reference that can be expanded when formal P1 documentation is located. Deliverable: P1 master reference structure with DeSilva-based content at `/sources/p1-master/`.
