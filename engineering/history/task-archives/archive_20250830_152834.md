### Task #1102
**Content:** Exit current session and restart with clean context after documenting automated testing system. After completing the automated testing documentation task, save all current progress and plans to context keys, then exit the session completely. Return with fresh context but armed with the automated testing reference document and tagged task filtering system. This clean restart eliminates context overhead that has accumulated during planning phase and ensures maximum focus and efficiency during the actual Smart Pins visual refinement execution work. Fresh context + organized external tasks + proper tooling = optimal execution environment.
