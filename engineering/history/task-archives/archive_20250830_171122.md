### Task #1167
**Content:** Create Green Book post-processing guide documenting required markdown changes. Based on the original Smart Pins markdown-changes-guide.md, create a simplified version for the Green Book Tutorial that documents: (1) What changes are needed from the Opus Master to prepare for PDF generation, (2) Verification of semantic div types (7 gap markers already in place), (3) Code block language tags verification (200+ blocks need spin2/pasm2/configuration tags), (4) Image path verification and documentation of missing images, (5) Any hex notation conversions needed ($FF vs 0xFF), (6) Special handling for tutorial elements like exercises and key takeaways. This guide will be simpler than the original because the Green Book was generated with many conventions already in place. Save as /exports/pdf-generation/workspace/smart-pins-manual/green-book-processing-guide.md. This ensures we have a repeatable process if we need to regenerate from the Opus Master.

### Task #1165
**Content:** Protect Green Book Opus Master with read-only permissions. Apply chmod 444 to /documentation/manuals/smart-pins-workshop/opus-master-green-book/P2-Smart-Pins-Green-Book-Tutorial.md to prevent accidental modification. Create README-SACRED.md in the same directory explaining: this is the master copy generated by Opus 4.1 on 2025-08-30, file size and line count, why it's protected (expensive AI generation, cannot be perfectly regenerated), working copy process (always copy to workspace for modifications). Document that this is the Green Book (Tutorial version) paired with Blue Book (Reference version). Follow same protection pattern as original Opus Master.

### Task #1166
**Content:** Commit Green Book Opus Master to Git repository for permanent preservation. Stage the entire /documentation/manuals/smart-pins-workshop/opus-master-green-book/ directory including the tutorial markdown and semantic types manifest. Create commit with message: 'Add Green Book Opus Master - P2 Smart Pins Complete Tutorial generated by Opus 4.1. This is the tutorial companion to the reference manual, covering all 32 Smart Pin modes with progressive learning approach. Protected with read-only permissions.' Verify commit succeeded and document the commit hash in the README-SACRED.md for future reference. This preserves the clean, unmodified master before any LaTeX escaping or processing.

### Task #1158
**Content:** Phase 1: Prepare Green Book markdown for PDF generation. Run latex-escape-all.sh on the Green Book Tutorial markdown file located at /documentation/manuals/smart-pins-workshop/opus-master-green-book/P2-Smart-Pins-Green-Book-Tutorial.md. Output the escaped version to /exports/pdf-generation/workspace/smart-pins-manual/P2-Smart-Pins-Green-Book-Tutorial-escaped.md. Verify all image paths reference assets/ correctly and that referenced images exist. Check that all 200+ code blocks have proper language tags (spin2, pasm2, or {.configuration}). Document any missing images or incorrect paths for later resolution.
