### Task #1159
**Content:** Phase 2: Create green-book-semantic-blocks.lua filter to handle the 7 semantic div types. FIRST READ: /exports/pdf-generation/workspace/smart-pins-manual/green-book-visual-specifications.md for exact specifications. The filter must convert divs to LaTeX environments as specified in Section 5 of the specifications document. All color values, border styles, and environment names are defined there. Save filter to /exports/pdf-generation/workspace/manual-templates/green-book-semantic-blocks.lua. Test filter can process all semantic types without errors. [green_book, lua_filter, phase2, sonnet] seq:4

### Task #1160
**Content:** Phase 3: Extend p2kb-smart-pins-content.sty with Green Book tutorial environments. Add tcolorbox definitions for all 7 gap marking environments (needsdiagram, needscodereview, needstechreview, preliminarycontent, needsexamples, needsverification, tipbox). Add tutorial-specific environments: exercise boxes (blue background, 'Exercise' title), keytakeaway boxes (green background, 'Key Takeaways' title), common-mistakes boxes (red-tinted, warning style). Ensure each environment has distinct visual styling with appropriate colors, borders, and icons/titles. Update file at /exports/pdf-generation/workspace/manual-templates/p2kb-smart-pins-content.sty. Consider readability for extended reading vs quick reference scanning.

### Task #1162
**Content:** Create comprehensive request.json for Green Book PDF generation. Configure pandoc_args array to include three filters in order: smart-pins-colored-blocks.lua (existing), green-book-semantic-blocks.lua (new), part-chapter-pagebreaks.lua (existing). Set template to p2kb-smart-pins.latex. Configure variables for documentclass: book, classoption: 11pt,twoside for larger tutorial text, and potentially add book-type: tutorial variable to trigger different styling behaviors. Save to /exports/pdf-generation/workspace/smart-pins-manual/request-green-book.json. Ensure all referenced templates and filters exist in the correct locations.
