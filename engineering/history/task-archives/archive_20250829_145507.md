### Task #1121
**Content:** Debug and fix Lua filter interference causing loss of code block coloring in Smart Pins PDF. During last night's PDF generation run, all syntax coloring was lost from the document - configuration blocks should be blue, Spin2 code should be green, and PASM2 assembly should be yellow, but none of these colors appeared. The document uses multiple Lua filters (likely including smart-pins-block-coloring.lua and others) that should work cooperatively to transform markdown code blocks marked with {.configuration}, ```spin2, and ```pasm2 into colored LaTeX environments (ConfigBlock, Spin2Block, PASM2Block defined in p2kb-smart-pins-content.sty). Need to investigate whether filters are running in wrong order, overwriting each other's changes, or not running at all. Check the pandoc_args array in request.json to ensure filters are specified correctly, verify filter execution order matters, test filters individually to confirm each works in isolation, then determine proper sequencing or modifications needed for them to work together. The coloring system is essential for the document's usability as it provides visual distinction between different code types, making the reference easier to scan and understand.

### Task #1101
**Content:** Generate final validation PDF with all visual improvements integrated and verify complete workflow. Create comprehensive test PDF including: cleaned mini TOC removal, all list formatting fixes applied, code block coloring system implemented and working. Validate that: (1) all visual requirements met, (2) no regressions introduced, (3) document maintains professional appearance, (4) automated testing workflow (if implemented) functions correctly end-to-end. Document any remaining visual issues for future refinement. This completes the visual presentation refinement cycle and prepares document for technical design review process.
