# Sprint 005: Documentation Accessibility & Discovery

**Sprint ID**: SPRINT-005
**Sprint Name**: Documentation Accessibility & Discovery  
**Date Created**: 2025-08-20
**Status**: Planning Complete

---

## Sprint Overview

**Purpose**: Make existing P2 knowledge accessible and bring our understanding current with all ingested sources.

**Key Objectives**:
- Consolidate scattered knowledge into master reference documents
- Extract and catalog 550+ code examples for individual access
- Create comprehensive audit of what we know vs what we need
- Establish P1 parallel reference for comparison
- Build foundation for AI-assisted P2 development

**Model Strategy Advisory**:
- Primary work in Sonnet 4 (Items 1, 2, 4, 5)
- Switch to Opus 4.1 only for Item 3 creative phases
- Minimize model switches (human interaction required)

## Sprint Items

### Item 1: AD-007 - PASM2 Master Instruction Table Creation/Audit

**Purpose**: Create the single source of truth for all 400+ PASM2 instructions.

**Deliverables**:
- Master PASM2 instruction table (living document)
- Complete attribute tracking per instruction:
  - Meta group membership
  - Clocking information
  - Flag modification capabilities
  - All known aspects
- Explicit gap marking: "MISSING: [aspect]"
- Narrative quality audit against master table

**Location**: `/sources/pasm2-master/instruction-table.md`

**Model**: Sonnet 4

**Advisory Notes**:
- This becomes THE foundational document
- All future ingestions enrich this table
- Raw/complete data over pretty formatting
- Similar approach applies to Spin2 later

---

### Item 2: AD-001 - Instruction Completion Matrix

**Purpose**: Consolidate all instruction-related questions and track completeness.

**Deliverables**:
- Unified question tracking matrix
- Source attribution for each question
- Answered vs unanswered status
- Two-perspective evaluation:
  - Source perspective: Did we extract everything?
  - Instruction perspective: What's still missing?
- Question-answer tracking template

**Key Features**:
- Maps questions to specific instructions
- Maintains provenance for back-annotation
- Guides missing information recovery strategy
- Drives future queries and source seeking

**Location**: `/sources/pasm2-master/completion-matrix.md`

**Model**: Sonnet 4

**Advisory Notes**:
- Focus on instruction-specific questions only
- Enable back-annotation to source documents
- Critical for knowledge completion strategy

---

### Item 3: AD-003 - DeSilva PDF Extraction → Voice Analysis → P2 Guide

**Purpose**: Extract P1 knowledge and teaching methodology for P2 documentation.

**Phase 1: PDF Extraction & Content Analysis** (Sonnet)
- Extract text via pdftotext
- Map P1 content coverage
- Begin P1 reference seed

**Phase 2: Voice & Pedagogical Analysis** (Opus 4.1)
- Analyze teaching voice and style
- Study pedagogical effectiveness
- Document improvements

**Phase 3: P1→P2 Mapping & Guide Creation** (Opus 4.1)
- Map P1 sections to P2 equivalents
- Identify new P2 features
- Create manual creation guide

**Phase 4: Dual Knowledge Base Seeding**
- P1 reference with master table structure
- P1 completion matrix
- Parallel to P2 reference

**Deliverables**:
1. Extracted text + P1 content map
2. Voice analysis document
3. Pedagogical analysis document
4. P2 manual creation guide
5. P1 reference seed (matrix + audit)

**Locations**:
- Extraction: `/sources/extractions/desilva-p1-tutorial/`
- P1 Reference: `/sources/p1-master/`
- Creation Guide: `/documentation/manuals/pasm2-manual/creation-guide.md`

**Model**: Sonnet for extraction, Opus 4.1 for analysis/creation

**Advisory Notes**:
- P1 knowledge incomplete until formal docs found
- Voice analysis stays with extraction
- Guide references voice location
- P1 uses same rigor as P2

---

### Item 4: AD-013 - Code Examples Catalog with Retroactive Audit

**Purpose**: Extract, organize, and catalog 550+ code examples for accessibility.

**Phase 1: Extraction & Organization**
- Extract from audit files
- Organize by topic/category (soft categories OK)
- Separate P1 and P2 examples

**Phase 2: Metadata Capture**
- Source section location
- Title and description
- Instruction/concept demonstrated
- Create review document

**Phase 3: Human Review Process**
- Generate review document
- Human validation/enrichment
- Re-ingest with "reviewed trust quality"

**Phase 4: Catalog Structure**
- Store with ingestion source
- Rich metadata for searchability
- Trigger "information available" event

**Phase 5: Retroactive Audit**
- Audit ALL existing ingestions
- Identify missing extractions
- Generate future sprint items

**Deliverables**:
- Organized code example folders
- Metadata-rich catalog
- Human review documents
- Gap list for future work

**Location**: `/sources/extractions/[source]/code-examples/`

**Model**: Sonnet 4

**Advisory Notes**:
- Don't overthink initial categorization
- Enables immediate AI assistant use
- Foundation for larger project ingestion

---

### Item 5: Audit Bundle - Cross-Ingestion Reconciliation

**Purpose**: Consolidate knowledge state and track progress.

**Phase 1: Answer Past Questions**
- Review all earlier questions
- Answer with new data
- Cite sources

**Phase 2: Consolidate Outstanding Questions**
- Create master gap list
- Update Operations Dashboard

**Phase 3: Progress Metrics**
- Coverage percentages
- Trust levels
- Gap counts
- Improvement metrics

**Phase 4: Sprint Documentation**
- Questions answered
- Knowledge gained
- Remaining gaps
- Quantified progress

**Deliverables**:
- Updated question status
- Current gap list
- Progress metrics
- Sprint summary
- Question-answer template

**Location**: `/sprints/sprint-005/audit-summary.md`

**Model**: Sonnet 4

**Advisory Notes**:
- Retroactive improvement focus
- Every answer needs citation
- Dashboard shows current state
- Sprint docs show journey

## Execution Guidance (Advisory)

### Model Optimization
**Recommended execution order to minimize switches**:
1. Execute Items 1, 2, 4, 5 in Sonnet 4
2. Switch to Opus 4.1 for Item 3 phases 2-3 only
3. Return to Sonnet 4 for Item 3 phase 4

**Rationale**: Single model switch instead of multiple

### Task Generation Suggestions
**Consider these optimizations (not requirements)**:
- Tag groups: AD-007, AD-001, AD-003, AD-013, Audit-Bundle
- Order to prevent rework
- Batch by model availability
- Dependencies between items

### Deferred Items
**PDF Ingestion Methodology**:
- Research best practices
- Preference: docx > PDF
- Tool needs for large PDF splitting
- Create methodology document when needed

---

## Success Criteria

1. Master PASM2 instruction table established
2. All questions consolidated with source attribution
3. DeSilva content extracted and analyzed
4. 550+ code examples cataloged
5. Knowledge gaps clearly identified
6. Progress metrics documented

---

## Notes

- All guidance is advisory, not mandatory
- Task generation has freedom to optimize
- Living documents - continuously improved
- Back-annotation to sources when questions answered
- Human review cycles for quality assurance
