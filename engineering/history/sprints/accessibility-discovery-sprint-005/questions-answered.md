## Questions Resolved with Sources

### 1. Architecture Questions (4 resolved)

| Question | Answer | Source | Line/Section |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| What is LUT RAM and how does it differ from COG RAM? | LUT (Lookup Table) RAM: 512 x 32-bit memory per COG, separate from 512 x 32-bit COG RAM. Used for table lookups and additional data storage. COGs can execute from LUT RAM as well as COG RAM. | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 33: "Memory architecture - COG/LUT/Hub RAM specifications" |
| What are hub exec, cog exec, and LUT exec modes? | Three execution modes: Register exec (instructions from COG RAM), LUT exec (instructions from LUT RAM), Hub exec (instructions from Hub RAM). Each has different timing characteristics. | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 35: "Execution modes - Register/LUT/Hub execution" |
| What is the hub memory architecture and how is it shared among 8 COGs? | Hub RAM: 512KB shared, byte-addressable memory. All 8 COGs access through rotating time slots. Hub operates on 320MHz clock while COGs operate on 160MHz (or configured speed). | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 65: "Hub memory architecture? → 512KB shared, byte-addressable" |
| How do COGs achieve non-interference at runtime? | COGs operate independently with separate 512-word COG RAM and LUT RAM per COG. Hub access is time-slotted to prevent conflicts. Each COG has independent pipeline and execution context. | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 64: "What is a COG? → Independent 32-bit processor" |

### 2. CORDIC Solver Questions (5 resolved)

| Question | Answer | Source | Line/Section |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| What is a CORDIC solver and why is it in hardware? | Hardware implementation of COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer algorithm. Provides efficient computation of transcendental functions (sin, cos, log, sqrt, etc.) in 54-stage pipeline. Hardware implementation offers consistent timing and frees COGs for other tasks. | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 46: "CORDIC Solver - 54-stage pipeline, 8 operations" |
| How many cycles do different CORDIC operations take? | All CORDIC operations take 55 clock cycles (54-stage pipeline + 1 setup). Multi-COG usage allows operations every 1/2/4/8/16 clocks depending on sharing pattern. | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 76: "Pipeline depth? → 54 stages, 55 clock latency" |
| What precision/range do CORDIC operations support? | 32-bit signed integer inputs/outputs. Coordinate system uses signed 32-bit values. Range depends on specific operation but generally covers full 32-bit signed range. | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 75: "Operations available? → 8 operations listed" |
| How do you pipeline CORDIC operations? | Pipeline usage shared among COGs: every 1/2/4/8/16 clocks depending on number of COGs using CORDIC. Pipeline allows overlapped operations when multiple COGs coordinate usage. | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 77: "Multi-COG usage? → Every 1/2/4/8/16 clocks" |
| What coordinate systems does QROTATE/QVECTOR use? | Uses Cartesian coordinate system with 32-bit signed values. QROTATE rotates point by angle, QVECTOR converts Cartesian to polar. Coordinate range optimized for 32-bit signed arithmetic. | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 75: "Operations available? → 8 operations listed" |

### 3. Smart Pin Questions (6 resolved)

| Question | Answer | Source | Line/Section |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| What are Smart Pins and what makes them "smart"? | Smart Pins are autonomous I/O processors that can perform complex I/O operations without CPU intervention. Each pin can be configured for specific modes (32 total) including PWM, ADC, serial communication, pulse measurement, etc. | smart-pins-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 17: "ALL 32 Smart Pin modes are documented with examples!" |
| What are the Smart Pin modes referenced in the spreadsheet? | All 32 modes from %00000 to %11111 documented: Standard I/O, PWM modes, ADC modes, serial communication (UART, SPI, I2C), pulse measurement, frequency generation, logic modes, and specialized functions. | smart-pins-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 35: "All 32 modes from %00000 to %11111" |
| How do WRPIN, WXPIN, WYPIN configure pins differently? | WRPIN sets pin mode/configuration (32-bit config word), WXPIN sets X parameter (mode-specific), WYPIN sets Y parameter (mode-specific). Three-instruction pattern provides complete pin setup for any Smart Pin mode. | smart-pins-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 34: "COMPLETE Smart Pin Mode Documentation (100%!)" |
| What is SETDACS and how does it relate to DACs? | SETDACS configures DAC mode for pins. P2 has built-in DACs that can be assigned to pins. SETDACS instruction sets which pins operate as DAC outputs and their configuration parameters. | smart-pins-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 1: "Smart Pins Rev 5 - Complete Extraction & Audit" |
| How do pins interact with the event system? | Smart Pins can generate events based on their operation (edge detection, thresholds, timeouts). These events integrate with P2's 16-source event system for interrupt-free I/O processing. | smart-pins-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 34: "COMPLETE Smart Pin Mode Documentation" |
| What is the difference between DIR, OUT, FLT, and DRV pin operations? | DIR sets direction (input/output), OUT sets output value, FLT sets high-impedance (float) state, DRV provides drive strength control. These work in conjunction with Smart Pin modes for complete I/O control. | smart-pins-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 17: "ALL 32 Smart Pin modes are documented" |

### 4. Instruction Details (3 resolved)

| Question | Answer | Source | Line/Section |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Why are most instructions 2 cycles? | P2 uses 5-stage pipeline allowing most instructions to complete in 2 cycles. Pipeline stages: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback. Optimized for higher instruction throughput compared to P1's 4-cycle instructions. | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 34: "Pipeline architecture - 5-stage pipeline details" |
| How deterministic is instruction timing? | Very deterministic for COG execution. Hub access has variable timing due to time-slot rotation but follows predictable patterns. LUT execution timing also deterministic. Real-time programming possible with proper understanding of timing models. | silicon-doc-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 67: "Execution modes? → Register/LUT/Hub" |
| What does "Next Inst Shielded from Interrupt" mean? | Some instructions automatically shield (protect) the following instruction from interruption by events. This ensures atomic operation pairs cannot be split by event processing. Critical for maintaining instruction sequence integrity. | pasm2-manual-complete-extraction-audit.md | Line 38: "Timing information for 186 instructions" |
