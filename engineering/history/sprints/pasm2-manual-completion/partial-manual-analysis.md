# PASM2 Partial Manual Analysis

*What works, what's missing, and what our audience needs*

---

## âœ… What's SUCCESSFUL in the Partial Manual

### Strong Points to Preserve:
1. **Consistent Structure** - Every instruction follows same template
2. **Bit-level Precision** - Encoding tables are exact
3. **Professional Tone** - Technical without being impenetrable
4. **Clear Syntax** - Instruction formats well-documented
5. **Flag Documentation** - C and Z effects clearly stated

### Why These Work:
- **Predictability** - Users know where to find information
- **Trustworthy** - Precision builds confidence
- **Scannable** - Consistent format aids quick lookup
- **Complete** (for what's there) - No half-documented instructions

## ðŸ”´ What's MISSING Given Our Audience

### For Production Developers (30%):
**Missing**:
- Hub boundary timing exceptions
- Pipeline stall conditions
- Interrupt interaction effects
- Silicon errata/workarounds

**Need to Add**:
- "Edge Cases" section for each instruction
- "Silicon Notes" for hardware realities

### For Driver Writers (25%):
**Missing**:
- Smart Pin interaction details
- Event/interrupt relationships
- Multi-cog coordination notes
- Performance optimization hints

**Need to Add**:
- "Common Usage" patterns
- "See Also" with related instructions

### For Learning Developers (20%):
**Missing**:
- ANY examples showing usage
- Conceptual explanations
- Common mistakes to avoid
- "Why would I use this?"

**Need to Add**:
- Minimal example for each instruction
- "Purpose" statement in plain language

### For Tool Developers (15%):
**Missing**:
- Undocumented behavior notes
- Alias information
- Assembler directive relationships
- Binary encoding edge cases

**Need to Add**:
- "Implementation Notes" section
- Complete encoding variations

### For P1 Veterans (10%):
**Missing**:
- P1â†’P2 migration notes
- "Replaces P1's XXX instruction"
- New capabilities highlights
- Gotchas for P1 users

**Need to Add**:
- "P1 Comparison" notes where relevant
- Migration warnings

## ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Instruction Template

Based on audience needs:

```markdown
### INSTRUCTION_NAME

**Purpose:** [Plain language: what problem does this solve?]

**Syntax:**
INSTRUCTION_NAME [{#}]S{,{#}D} {WC,WZ,WCZ}

**Encoding:**
EEEE OOOOOOO CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS

**Description:**
[Technical description - current style retained]

**Timing:**
Base: 2 clocks
Hub crossing: +1 clock
Interrupts: [effect if any]

**Flags:**
C: [effect]
Z: [effect]

**Example:** [Only if critical for understanding]
```spin2
INSTRUCTION_NAME  reg1, #5  ' Brief comment
```

**Edge Cases:**
- [Any special conditions]
- [Pipeline interactions]

**P1 Note:** [If applicable]
Replaces P1's XXX instruction with enhanced...

**See Also:**
[Related instructions]
```

## ðŸ“Š Friction Reduction Strategy

### Current Friction Points:
1. **No examples** - Users experiment to understand
2. **No edge cases** - Users discover problems in production
3. **No context** - Users don't know when to use instructions
4. **No migration help** - P1 users struggle

### Friction Reducers:
1. **Minimal examples** - Just enough to clarify
2. **Edge case notes** - Prevent production surprises
3. **Purpose statements** - Quick "why use this"
4. **P1 notes** - Smooth transition path

---

## âœ… Success Metrics

The manual succeeds when:
- **Production devs** ship without instruction surprises
- **Driver writers** find all timing they need
- **Learners** understand without external help
- **Tool devs** can implement assemblers
- **P1 veterans** transition smoothly
