## THE SIMPLE PLAN

1. **Take what we have**:
   - Partial manual (9174 lines with Parallax style)
   - Complete spreadsheet (491 instructions)
   - Silicon doc (hardware context)

2. **Fill the gaps**:
   - Add missing ~340 instructions
   - Use existing Parallax format exactly
   - Keep same professional tone

3. **Ship it**:
   - Version 1.0 = Complete instruction coverage
   - Don't wait for perfect
   - Examples can come in v1.1

**That's it. Start → Fill gaps → Ship.**
