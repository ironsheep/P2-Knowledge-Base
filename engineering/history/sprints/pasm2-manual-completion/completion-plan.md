# PASM2 Manual Completion Plan

**Document Type**: EXTENDING existing partial manual
**Current State**: 9174 lines extracted, ~30% of instructions documented
**Target**: Complete PASM2 Assembly Language Reference Manual

---

## üìä Current Document Assessment

### What the Partial Manual Has:
- ‚úÖ Professional Parallax formatting style established
- ‚úÖ Document structure and organization defined
- ‚úÖ Some instructions documented with proper format
- ‚úÖ Introduction and overview sections
- ‚úÖ Condition codes section (partial)

### What Needs Evaluation:
- üîç Are overview sections RIGHT for our target audiences?
- üîç Do we adequately introduce processor regions and instruction groupings?
- üîç Is alphabetical organization optimal, or should we use feature-based grouping?
- üîç If alphabetical, should it be an appendix with main content feature-organized?

### Proposed Structure: Multi-Ingress, Single Content

**Part 1: Hardware Feature Exploration** (Understanding P2)
- COG Architecture (8 parallel processors, registers, memory)
- Hub Memory System (shared memory, timing windows)
- Smart Pins (64 independent I/O processors)
- CORDIC Engine (mathematical coprocessor)
- Lock System (inter-cog coordination)
- Each section: Complete mental model + relevant instructions

**Part 2: Software Task Navigation** (Using P2)
- Memory Management (COG/LUT/HUB access patterns)
- I/O Operations (pin control, serial, protocols)
- Mathematical Operations (arithmetic, DSP, CORDIC)
- Program Flow (branches, loops, interrupts)
- Inter-COG Communication (locks, mailboxes, events)
- Each section: Task-oriented view of same instructions

**Part 3: Complete Instruction Reference** (The actual content)
- Instructions appear ONCE here
- Rich documentation with functional examples
- Cross-references to Part 1 & 2 appearances
- Audience-aware sections:
  - **Concept**: For new engineers (when needed)
  - **Usage**: Functional examples (always)
  - **Advanced**: For complex cases (graduated)

**Part 4: Alphabetical Index** (Quick Access)
- Every instruction A-Z
- Links to Part 3 full documentation
- Notes which features (Part 1) and tasks (Part 2) use it

### What's Missing (High Friction Points):
- üî¥ ~340 instructions not documented at all
- üî¥ **Functional examples** (3-5 lines showing real use - CRITICAL)
- üî¥ Cross-references between hardware features and software tasks
- üî¥ Complete flag effects documentation
- üî¥ Instruction timing details for many
- üî¥ **Rich style guide extraction** (CRITICAL for consistency)
- üî¥ **Infographics opportunities** (identify where visual aids would help):
  - Hub timing windows visualization
  - COG memory architecture diagram
  - Smart Pin configuration flow
  - Pipeline interaction illustrations

### Gap Identification Method:
- Evaluate against document PURPOSE (complete PASM2 reference)
- Consider COMMUNITY needs (what do P2 developers require?)
- Assess RICHNESS (sufficient detail for practical use?)
- Not just "what's literally missing" but "what SHOULD be there"

### Source Materials Available:
1. **P2 Instructions v35 Spreadsheet** - All 491 instructions with timing/encoding
2. **Silicon Documentation** - Hardware context and behavior
3. **Existing Partial Manual** - Style template and structure

### How Different Audiences Will Navigate:

**New Engineers** ‚Üí Part 1 (Hardware) ‚Üí Part 3 (Instructions)
- Need complete mental model first
- Will read conceptual sections
- Want graduated examples

**Experienced Devs with Task** ‚Üí Part 2 (Tasks) ‚Üí Part 3 (Instructions)
- Know what they need to do
- Want task-oriented groupings
- Skip to functional examples

**Highly Trained Devs** ‚Üí Part 1 or 2 ‚Üí Deep dive Part 3
- Want to understand P2 deeply

### Documentation Must Provide:
- **Clear section labeling** so users identify their path
- **Rich enough content** to skip irrelevant sections
- **Functional examples** always (intent must be clear)
- **Graduated complexity** for concepts like Smart Pins
- **Visual aids** where they reduce cognitive load
- **Strong Pattern Recognition**: Consistent instruction format for easy navigation

### Document Boundary Decisions:

#### PASM2 Manual vs Smart Pins Document:
- **In PASM2**: Essential Smart Pin instructions and basic usage
- **In Smart Pins Doc**: Rich detail, all modes, complete patterns
- **Strategy**: PASM2 gives quick start, references Smart Pins doc for depth

#### PASM2 Manual vs DeSilva Guide:
- **In PASM2**: Technical reference, minimal learning narrative
- **In DeSilva**: Progressive learning, extensive examples
- **Strategy**: PASM2 assumes knowledge, DeSilva builds it

#### PASM2 Manual vs P1 Migration Guide:
- **In PASM2**: Brief P1 notes where relevant
- **In Migration Guide**: Complete transition strategy
- **Strategy**: PASM2 focuses on P2, separate doc for migration

#### PASM2 Manual vs Emulator Development Guide:
- **In PASM2**: SKIP instruction documentation
- **In Emulator Guide**: Complete emulation patterns and techniques
- **Strategy**: Consider separate advanced guide for emulation

## üéØ Completion Strategy

### Approach: NEW Document Using Extracted Style
- **Extract**: Capture Parallax documentation style from partial
- **Create Fresh**: Build complete document from scratch
- **Apply Style**: Use extracted style guide consistently throughout
- **Quality Built-in**: Style consistency automatic, not tested

### Source Ambiguity Resolution:
- **NO hierarchy**: Don't trust one source over another
- **Mismatches = Low Trust Zones**: Flag ALL conflicts
- **Create Questions**: Every mismatch becomes a question
- **Build Trust**: Resolve to get single truth
- **Track in Document**: Note all ambiguities for resolution

---

## üìã Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Style Extraction & Gap Analysis
1. [ ] Extract Parallax documentation style guide from existing content
2. [ ] Create instruction documentation template
3. [ ] Map all 491 instructions against existing manual
4. [ ] Categorize missing instructions by type
5. [ ] Identify incomplete instruction entries

### Phase 2: Systematic Documentation Generation
1. [ ] Create document structure first (overall organization)
2. [ ] Build section by section systematically
3. [ ] For each instruction:
   - Pull data from ALL sources
   - Note any mismatches as questions
   - Apply Parallax documentation template
   - Format according to established style
4. [ ] No prioritization - work through structure systematically

### Phase 3: Enhancement of Existing Entries
For partially documented instructions:
1. [ ] Add missing timing information
2. [ ] Complete flag effects documentation

**Encoding:**
EEEE OOOOOOO CZI DDDDDDDDD SSSSSSSSS

**Description:**
Clear, technical description of what the instruction does.

**Flags:**
C: Description of C flag effect
Z: Description of Z flag effect

**Timing:**
2 clocks (specific conditions if applicable)

**See Also:**
Related instructions listed here
```

### Critical Style Rules:
- Use exact formatting from existing manual
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Present information in same order
- Keep technical precision without being verbose

   ### [INSTRUCTION]
   
   **Syntax:**
   [From spreadsheet column B]
   
   **Encoding:**
   [From spreadsheet columns showing bit patterns]
   
   **Description:**
   [Generate from instruction name and category]
   
   **Flags:**
   [From spreadsheet flag columns]
   
   **Timing:**
   [From spreadsheet timing column]
   ```

3. **Integrate Seamlessly**:
   - Place in correct alphabetical position
