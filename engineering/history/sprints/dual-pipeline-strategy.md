# Dual Pipeline Strategy

**Created**: 2025-08-14
**Purpose**: Keep both pipelines fed and flowing for continuous progress

## 🔄 THE TWO PIPELINES

### Pipeline 1: DOCUMENT GENERATION (Breadth - What We Deliver)
**Purpose**: Visible value to sponsors and community

**Currently Active**:
1. ✅ PASM2 Reference Manual v1.0 (ready to execute)
2. ✅ deSilva-style P2 Guide v0.1 (ready to execute)
3. 🟡 AI-Optimized Reference v1.0 (planned)

**Queue for Consideration**:
- Smart Pins Complete Reference
- P2 Quick Reference Card
- P2 Boot Process Guide
- SPIN2 Language Reference
- P2 Migration Guide (detailed)
- Educational Materials (high school level)

**Feed Question**: What documents provide most value next?

---

### Pipeline 2: SOURCE INGESTION (Depth - What We Learn)
**Purpose**: Enrich knowledge for better outputs

**Currently Completed**:
1. ✅ PASM2 Spreadsheet (491 instructions)
2. ✅ Silicon Documentation
3. ✅ SPIN2 v51 Document

**Queue for Processing**:
4. 🔴 P2 Datasheet PDF (awaiting)
5. 🔴 P2 Spec Sheet PDF (awaiting)
6. 🔴 P2 ROM Monitor/Debugger Forum Post (new!)
7. 🟡 Runtime Interpreter Code (gated)
8. 🟡 Flash File System Code (future)
9. 🟡 BLDC Motor Driver Code (future)

**Feed Question**: What sources give most understanding next?

## 📊 PIPELINE HEALTH METRICS

### Healthy Pipeline Indicators:
- ✅ Always 2-3 items ready to execute
- ✅ Always 2-3 sources queued to ingest
- ✅ Neither pipeline empty
- ✅ Progress on both fronts weekly

### Warning Signs:
- ⚠️ One pipeline empty
- ⚠️ Only working one pipeline
- ⚠️ No new items identified
- ⚠️ Stalled on "perfect" instead of progress

## 🎯 FEEDING STRATEGIES

### How to Feed Document Pipeline:
- Review community requests
- Check sponsor needs
- Identify market gaps
- Version existing docs
- Create specialized views

### How to Feed Source Pipeline:
- Browse Parallax documents page
- Check forum discussions
- Review OBEX for patterns
- Ask community for examples
- Identify reference implementations

## 📅 REVIEW CYCLES

### Weekly Pipeline Review:
- [ ] Both pipelines have work?
- [ ] Priority items identified?
- [ ] Blockers being addressed?
- [ ] New sources discovered?

### Release-Driven Review:
- [ ] What enables next release?
- [ ] What knowledge gaps exist?
- [ ] What would wow sponsors?
- [ ] What unblocks markets?

## 🚀 CURRENT PIPELINE STATUS

### Document Pipeline: 🟢 HEALTHY
- 2 ready to execute
- 1 in planning
- Multiple identified for future

### Source Pipeline: 🟡 NEEDS ATTENTION
- 3 completed
- 3 awaiting materials
- 1 new to investigate (ROM/Forth)
- Several future identified

**Action**: Process ROM Monitor/Debugger source next

## 📝 PLANNING QUESTIONS FOR LATER

1. How do we know when we have "enough" sources?
2. What triggers moving items between pipelines?
3. How do we balance breadth vs depth?
4. When do we stop feeding and just execute?
5. How do we know a pipeline is "complete"?

*Keep both pipelines flowing - stagnation in either hurts overall progress*
