# Silicon Document Processing Sprint - Planning Document

**Sprint Planned**: August 2025  
**Planning Approach**: Hardware foundation layer after PASM2 instruction base
**Strategic Reasoning**: Need silicon capabilities to understand what PASM2 instructions can accomplish

---

## PLANNED OBJECTIVES

### Primary Goal:
**Establish comprehensive P2 hardware capability foundation** for understanding instruction context and practical programming

### Why This Sprint After PASM2:
- **Instruction Context**: PASM2 instructions need hardware capability context
- **Bottom-Up Strategy**: Hardware capabilities → Instruction usage → High-level programming
- **Integration Validation**: Check if silicon features align with documented instructions
- **Smart Pin Foundation**: Critical P2 differentiator needs detailed documentation

---

## PLANNED APPROACH

### Source Processing Plan:
1. **P2 Architecture Overview**: 8-cog system with shared hub memory
2. **Smart Pin System**: 64 programmable I/O pins with multiple modes
3. **CORDIC Solver**: Mathematical coprocessor capabilities  
4. **Memory Systems**: Hub/Cog memory model and timing characteristics
5. **Debug Features**: Hardware debugging and development support

### Cross-Reference Plan:
1. **PASM2 Validation**: Do silicon features support documented instructions?
2. **Gap Analysis**: What silicon features lack instruction support?
3. **Integration Opportunities**: Where do hardware and software connect?

## ANTICIPATED CHALLENGES

### Expected Difficulties:
- **Complex Tables**: Timing and configuration tables may be hard to interpret
- **Visual Information**: Diagrams and charts may need special handling
- **Technical Depth**: Silicon-level details require careful interpretation
- **Cross-Reference Complexity**: Matching hardware features to instructions challenging

### Mitigation Plans:
- **Visual Documentation**: Plan for screenshot and diagram collection
- **Technical Validation**: Identify questions needing designer clarification
- **Systematic Processing**: Use established audit methodology from PASM2 sprint
