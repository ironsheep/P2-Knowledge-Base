## 📊 Overall Health: 🟡 PARTIAL

### Component Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Content Extraction** | ✅ 90% | 16 sections extracted, 2 incomplete (boot, bytecode) |
| **Technical Audit** | ⏳ Pending | Needs systematic completeness audit |
| **Style Guide** | 🔴 Not Started | Parallax official style not yet extracted |
| **Cross-References** | 🟡 Partial | Some validation done with PASM2 |
| **Source Attribution** | ✅ Complete | Page numbers tracked |

## 🔍 Extraction Details

### What We Have:
- ✅ Architecture overview (COGs, memory, pipeline)
- ✅ Smart Pin documentation (all 32 modes listed)
- ✅ CORDIC operations (8 functions documented)
- ✅ Events and interrupts (all 16 events)
- ✅ Debug features (hidden interrupt, register save)
- ✅ Hub interface and timing
- ✅ Lock system (16 semaphores)

### What's Missing:
- 🔴 Boot process details (only headers, Chip must provide)
- 🔴 Bytecode execution (marked "to be completed")
- 🔴 Visual content (pages 76-84 schematics)
- 🟡 Some condition code values (EEEE 0000-1111)

### Style Analysis Needed:
- Register description patterns
- Bit field documentation approach
- Technical specification format
- Cross-reference methodology
- Note/warning conventions
- Table and diagram usage

## 📋 Enrichment Tasks

### Priority 2 (After new documents):
1. [ ] Complete technical audit
2. [ ] Validate against PASM2 instructions
3. [ ] Identify remaining gaps

### Priority 3 (Enrichment phase):
1. [ ] Extract Parallax style guide
2. [ ] Create style replication template
3. [ ] Document distinctive features

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Document will be ✅ COMPLETE when:
- [ ] All available content extracted (excluding Chip's sections)
- [ ] Technical audit validates completeness
- [ ] Style guide fully documented
- [ ] Cross-references verified
- [ ] Ready for synthesis
