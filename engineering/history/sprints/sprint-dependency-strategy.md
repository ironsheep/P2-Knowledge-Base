# Sprint Dependency Strategy & Execution Order

**Strategic Planning Date**: 2025-08-14
**Purpose**: Optimal sequencing for maximum value delivery

---

## ðŸŽ¯ THE STRATEGIC SEQUENCE

### Layer 1: Source Enrichment (Foundation)
**Not blocking documents, but enhances everything**

1. **PASM2 Spreadsheet** (âœ… Complete, needs validation)
2. **Silicon Documentation** (âœ… Complete, needs validation)  
3. **SPIN2 v51** (âœ… Complete, 19 questions pending)
4. **P2 Datasheet PDF** (ðŸ”´ Need from user)
5. **P2 Spec Sheet PDF** (ðŸ”´ Need from user)

**Why enrich first**: Better source knowledge = better output quality
**But**: Don't wait for perfection to start documents!

---

### Layer 2: Document Generation (Value Delivery)
**Can start NOW, improves with enrichment**

1. **PASM2 Reference Manual** 
   - Can start with existing extractions
   - Will improve as sources enriched
   - Delivers immediate value to Parallax leadership

2. **deSilva-style P2 Guide**
   - Can start with style extraction
   - Benefits from enriched understanding
   - Delivers community dream

3. **AI-Optimized Reference**
   - Benefits MOST from enriched sources
   - Should incorporate all learnings
   - Gates on source quality

---

### Layer 3: Validation Sprints (Advanced)
**GATED by enriched sources**

1. **Runtime Interpreter Analysis**
   - Needs solid foundation to validate against
   - Provides canonical patterns
   - Best done after source enrichment

2. **Flash File System Analysis**
   - Future sprint
   - Needs foundation knowledge

3. **BLDC Motor Driver Analysis**
   - Future sprint
   - Needs foundation knowledge

---

## ðŸ“Š OPTIMAL EXECUTION PLAN

### Week 1: Parallel Execution
**Morning**: Source Enrichment
- Process Datasheet + Spec Sheet PDFs (if provided)
- Answer pending SPIN2 questions
- Validate existing extractions

**Afternoon**: Document Generation
- PASM2 Manual completion
- deSilva style extraction and outlining
- Don't wait for perfect sources!

### Week 2: Integration & Validation
- Incorporate enriched sources into documents
- Begin AI-Optimized Reference
- Plan Interpreter Validation Sprint

---

## ðŸš¦ GATING DECISIONS

### NOT GATED (Start Immediately):
âœ… **PASM2 Manual** - Have enough to start
âœ… **deSilva Guide** - Style extraction can begin
âœ… **Source Enrichment** - PDFs when available

### SOFT GATED (Better with enrichment):
ðŸŸ¡ **AI-Optimized Reference** - Benefits from complete sources
ðŸŸ¡ **Final Manual Polish** - Benefits from answered questions

### HARD GATED (Must wait):
ðŸ”´ **Interpreter Validation** - Needs solid foundation
ðŸ”´ **Pattern Extraction** - Needs validated knowledge
ðŸ”´ **Code Generation Testing** - Needs complete reference

---

## ðŸ’¡ KEY INSIGHT

**The User's Wisdom**:
"While AI ingestion is gated by enriched sources, the two documents are NOT gated"

This means:
1. Start documents NOW with what we have
2. Enrich sources in parallel
3. Continuously improve documents as sources enriched
4. Don't let perfect be enemy of good

**The Interpreter Sprint**:
- Planning document MUST be created tonight
- Even if execution waits for enriched sources
- Captures current thinking while fresh
- Ready to execute when gate opens

---

## ðŸ“‹ TONIGHT'S DELIVERABLES

Before we end this session:

1. âœ… **Interpreter Sprint Planning** - Initial document created
2. â¬œ **PASM2 Manual Sprint** - Ready for execution
3. â¬œ **deSilva Guide Sprint** - Ready for execution  
4. â¬œ **Source Enrichment Plan** - What questions need answers

---

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Next 10 Minutes:
1. Finalize Interpreter Sprint planning document
2. Quick gap analysis for PASM2 Manual
3. Capture deSilva style patterns

### If PDFs Provided:
1. Rapid extraction of key information
2. Identify cross-validation opportunities
3. Queue for deep processing

*Strategy: Parallel progress on multiple fronts, don't gate unnecessarily!*
