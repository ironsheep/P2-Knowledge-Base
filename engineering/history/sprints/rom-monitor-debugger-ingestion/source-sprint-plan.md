# ROM Monitor/Debugger Source Sprint

**Source**: P2 ROM Monitor/Debugger Forum Documentation
**URL**: https://forums.parallax.com/discussion/170638/p2-rom-monitor-debugger-rev-1-rev-2-silicon
**Type**: Source Ingestion Sprint
**Priority**: Medium (enriches boot/debug understanding)

---

## ðŸ“‹ WHAT THIS SOURCE PROVIDES

### New Knowledge Areas:
1. **Built-in Debugging System** - ROM-based monitor in top 16KB
2. **Boot Process Details** - How P2 starts up and enters debug mode
3. **Forth Integration** - TAQOZ Forth in ROM (explains that mysterious PDF!)
4. **Callable Routines** - ROM utilities available to all programs

### Fills These Gaps:
- Boot process documentation (identified as gap earlier)
- Debug capabilities built into silicon
- ROM resources available to developers
- Alternative development path (Forth)

## ðŸŽ¯ INGESTION PLAN

### Quick Extraction (30 mins):
1. Read main forum post thoroughly
2. Extract technical specifications
3. Document command structure
4. Note memory maps and addresses
5. Identify related resources

### Deep Analysis (if valuable):
1. Map ROM monitor commands to use cases
2. Create boot sequence diagram
3. Document Forth integration points
4. Extract callable routine signatures

## ðŸ“Š VALUE ASSESSMENT

### Why This Matters:
- **Unique P2 Feature**: Built-in monitor/debugger in ROM
- **Developer Tool**: Direct hardware debugging capability
- **Boot Understanding**: Explains P2 startup sequence
- **Forth Option**: Third language option (PASM2, SPIN2, Forth)

### Integration Opportunities:
- Enhances debugging section of manual
- Adds boot process to architecture docs
- Explains that TAQOZ PDF we couldn't process
- Provides ROM utility reference
