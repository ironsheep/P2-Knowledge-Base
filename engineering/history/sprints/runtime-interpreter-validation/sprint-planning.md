## ‚ùì PLANNING QUESTIONS

### Source Understanding:
**Q: What is the runtime interpreter's role in P2 ecosystem?**
A: Core bytecode execution engine that all SPIN2 programs depend on. Written collaboratively by Chip (architecture) and User (optimizations).

**Q: What makes this source canonical?**
A: It's THE production interpreter everyone uses - represents agreed-upon best practices and optimal P2 usage patterns.

**Q: What specific patterns should we extract?**
A: Bytecode dispatch mechanisms, instruction optimization techniques, memory management patterns, cog coordination strategies.

### Analysis Approach:
**Q: How should we structure the analysis?**
A: Layer-by-layer: bytecode format ‚Üí dispatch loop ‚Üí instruction handlers ‚Üí optimization patterns ‚Üí architectural insights.

**Q: What validation criteria should we use?**
A: Can we explain every PASM2 instruction used? Does usage match our documentation? Are there patterns we didn't know about?

**Q: How do we capture patterns for reuse?**
A: Create pattern templates with context, implementation, and usage guidelines for each identified pattern.

### Integration Questions:
**Q: How does this validate our PASM2 understanding?**
A: Shows real-world instruction usage, performance considerations, and patterns we may have missed.

**Q: What SPIN2 compilation insights will we gain?**
A: Understanding bytecode format reveals how SPIN2 constructs map to execution.

**Q: What gaps might this expose?**
A: Undocumented optimizations, silicon feature usage patterns, performance techniques not in specs.

## üìÖ EXECUTION PLAN

### Independent Execution Ready:
This sprint can proceed independently once planning is complete. No external dependencies or user input required during execution.

### Time Allocation:
- Overview & Architecture: 2 hours
- Bytecode Format Analysis: 2 hours
- Dispatch Mechanism: 1 hour
- Instruction Handlers: 3 hours
- Pattern Extraction: 2 hours
- Documentation: 2 hours
**Total Estimate**: 12 hours

## ‚úÖ PLANNING DECISIONS

### Technical Approach:
1. **Analyze all bytecode instructions** - Comprehensive understanding needed
2. **Document optimization tricks** - These are the "gold" for P2 patterns
3. **Single interpreter focus** - This is THE canonical implementation

### Scope Decisions:
1. **Include initialization** - Important for understanding architecture
2. **Document error patterns** - Yes, valuable for robust code generation
3. **Extract debug patterns** - Yes, helps development workflow

### Integration Approach:
1. **Separate pattern library** - `/patterns/` directory for reusability
2. **Cross-reference in docs** - Link patterns from instruction docs
3. **High priority for AI** - These are canonical examples
