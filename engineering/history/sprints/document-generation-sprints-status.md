# Document Generation Sprints - Status & Planning

**Assessment Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Purpose**: Track our three major document deliverables

---

## ðŸ“š THE THREE MAJOR DOCUMENTS

### Document 1: P2-for-P1 Users Guide (deSilva Style)
**Audience**: P1 programmers transitioning to P2  
**Style Guide**: deSilva's beloved P1 Assembly Tutorial
**Purpose**: Gentle learning curve using familiar teaching approach

**Current Status**:
- âœ… Have deSilva PDF for style extraction
- âœ… Understand the teaching approach needed
- ðŸ”´ Not started writing yet

**To Be Execution Ready**:
- [ ] Extract deSilva style patterns
- [ ] Outline P2-for-P1 transition topics
- [ ] Plan chapter structure
- [ ] Generate task instructions
**Time to Ready**: 30-40 minutes

---

### Document 2: Complete PASM2 Reference Manual (Parallax Style)
**Audience**: Professional developers needing comprehensive reference
**Style Guide**: Official Parallax format from partial manual
**Purpose**: Complete, authoritative PASM2 instruction reference

**Current Status**:
- âœ… Extracted 9174 lines from draft manual
- âœ… Have Parallax style template
- âœ… Have all 491 instructions from spreadsheet
- ðŸŸ¡ Need to merge and complete

**To Be Execution Ready**:
- [ ] Audit what's missing from partial manual
- [ ] Map spreadsheet instructions to manual gaps
- [ ] Plan completion approach
- [ ] Generate task instructions  
**Time to Ready**: 20-30 minutes

---

### Document 3: AI-Optimized P2 Reference
**Audience**: AI systems (Claude as first consumer)
**Style Guide**: Structured, parseable, comprehensive
**Purpose**: Enable AI to generate production P2 code

**Current Status**:
- âœ… Created v0.1.0 structure in `/ai-reference/`
- âœ… Have foundation knowledge from 3 completed sprints
- ðŸŸ¡ Needs integration and completion

**To Be Execution Ready**:
- [ ] Define v1.0 completion criteria
- [ ] Plan integration of all sources
- [ ] Structure for AI consumption
- [ ] Generate task instructions
**Time to Ready**: 20-30 minutes

## ðŸ“Š SPRINT INTERDEPENDENCIES

### Foundation Requirements:
All three documents depend on the **completed source processing**:
- âœ… PASM2 Spreadsheet (491 instructions)
- âœ… Silicon Documentation (hardware)
- âœ… SPIN2 v51 (language specification)

### Validation Requirements:
- **AI Reference** â†’ Validates through code generation testing
- **PASM2 Manual** â†’ Validates against spreadsheet + silicon
- **P2-for-P1 Guide** â†’ Validates through educational use

---

## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Parallel Execution Possible:
- All three can be worked on independently
- Different styles prevent interference
- Each serves different audience

### Recommended Sequence:
1. **First**: Complete PASM2 Manual (builds on existing extraction)
2. **Second**: AI Reference v1.0 (enables sponsor validation)
3. **Third**: P2-for-P1 Guide (benefits from other two)

### Quick Wins Available:
- **PASM2 Manual**: Can quickly audit gaps (10 mins)
- **AI Reference**: Can define v1.0 scope (10 mins)
- **P2-for-P1**: Can extract deSilva style (10 mins)

## ðŸš€ 30-MINUTE QUICK START PLAN

### Get All Three Document Sprints Execution-Ready:

**10 minutes - PASM2 Manual Sprint**:
1. Audit gaps between draft manual and spreadsheet
2. Define completion approach
3. Create sprint planning doc

**10 minutes - AI Reference Sprint**:
1. Define v1.0 integration plan
2. Structure for AI consumption  
3. Create sprint planning doc

**10 minutes - P2-for-P1 Guide Sprint**:
1. Extract key deSilva style patterns
2. Outline transition topics
3. Create sprint planning doc

**Result**: All three document sprints ready for execution!

## ðŸ“‹ KEY QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE

### For PASM2 Manual:
- Include code examples for every instruction?
- How to handle the 60+ questions from spreadsheet?
- Cross-reference with silicon documentation?

### For AI Reference:
- What format is most AI-consumable?
- How deep into examples should v1.0 go?
- Include pattern library from validation sprints?

### For P2-for-P1 Guide:
- Which P2 features to emphasize for P1 users?
- How many chapters for v0.1?
- Include comparison tables P1 vs P2?
