### Trust Level System Introduction
Every piece of information is tagged with trust levels:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Verified from official Parallax documentation
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Inferred from context or partial documentation
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Community knowledge, needs verification

Trust levels reflect **source reliability**, not priority. When sources conflict, trust decreases.

### V2 Extraction Methodology (Changelog)
**Major improvement from V1:** Extracted from .docx source files instead of PDFs
- Solved formatting issues (tables, code examples)
- Improved accuracy (no OCR errors)
- Better structure preservation
- Enabled trust level tracking per source

### Pipeline for Remaining Gaps
1. **Immediate**: Query Chip Gracey for 290 instruction descriptions
2. **Pending**: Ada's website in Germany (potential instruction details)
3. **Community**: Forum feedback on missing pieces
4. **Continuous**: Update with each new source discovered

### JSON Format Purpose
- Built specifically for AI training and ingestion
- Designed for AIs to consume when training on P2 code generation
- Community requested "full catalog of instructions for AI consumption"
- Claude (you) will design the optimal JSON structure for this v1.0 release
- Community feedback will drive future format improvements

---

## 3. Target Audiences & Phasing

### Document Update Strategy
**IMPORTANT**: All communication documents will be updated TWICE:
1. **Now**: Update with current V2 extraction metrics
2. **Before Send**: Update again after Chip's input & Ada's site ingestion

### Phase 1: Private Validation (After Next Ingestion)
**Audience**: Parallax leadership and P2 architect
- **Method**: Direct email with professional PDF proposal
- **Message**: "Unlocking P2's potential for AI code generation"
- **Credit**: Chip as collaborator/technical advisor
- **Ask**: Review gaps, provide missing documentation sources
- **Note**: Ken already has repo access for monitoring

### Phase 2: Community Validation (After Sponsor Response)
**Audience**: Parallax Forum Members
- **Method**: Forum announcement post (pre-written, updated with latest metrics)
- **Message**: "P2 Knowledge Base ready for AI code generation testing"
- **Request**: 
  - Technical validation of content
  - Test with their preferred AI tools
  - Report what works/doesn't work
- **Timeline**: 48 hours after Ken/Chip email (or proceed if no response)

### Phase 3: Public Release (After Community Feedback)
**Audience**: Broader developer community, AI systems
- **Method**: GitHub release, changelog update
- **Focus**: Code generation AI platforms
- **Tested With**: 
  - Claude/Claude Code (primary, tested by us)
  - Request community testing with: GPT-4, Gemini, Local LLMs
- **Message**: "Help us expand P2 AI code generation support"

### AI Platform Support Tracking
**Changelog will track**:
- "Tested with: Claude Code" (v1.0)
- "Now supports: [Platform]" (as validated)
- Focus on code generation capable AIs
- Community feedback drives platform expansion

### Legal & Attribution Considerations
- **Copyright**: Defer to Parallax (as partial sponsor)
- **Production Credit**: IronSheep Productions LLC as contributor
- **License Review**: Flag for Ken's review before public release
- **Open Question**: MIT license appropriate for documentation?

### Communication Tone Guidelines
- **Do**: Enable and empower the community
- **Do**: Let results speak for themselves  
- **Do**: Focus on unlocking potential
- **Don't**: Claim we did the impossible
- **Don't**: Be self-important
- **Example**: "Unlocking P2 for AI code generation" not "We achieved the impossible"

### Timeline Context
- **3 weeks**: Live demo showing Claude generating P2 code
- **Goal**: Meaningful v1.0 that enables demo success
- **Priority**: Claude Code compatibility first, expand later

---

## 4. Versioning Strategy

### Version Numbering Philosophy
**Major Version = Number of Published Documents**
- v1.0.0 = 1 document published (P2 Knowledge Base)
- v2.0.0 = 2 documents published
- This is our experimental approach for documentation projects

### Version Numbering Scheme
- **Major** (X.0.0) = New document published to community
- **Minor** (x.X.0) = Significant quality improvements from new sources
- **Patch** (x.x.X) = Small fixes, typos, minor updates

### Examples of Version Triggers
- **Major**: Publishing PASM2 Manual as separate document â†’ v2.0.0
- **Minor**: Ada's site adds 45 instruction descriptions â†’ v1.1.0
- **Minor**: Community validates 60 yellow items to green â†’ v1.2.0
- **Patch**: Fix typos in 5 instructions â†’ v1.0.1

### Release Philosophy
- **Content-driven, not time-based** - Release when meaningful improvement exists
- **Quality triggers releases** - New source improves documentation significantly
- **Validation triggers releases** - Community confirms accuracy
- **Don't wait** - If 45 of 60 items validated, release it
- **x.0.0 indicates** - Brand new document, not yet refined

### Not Using
- No pre-release tags (rc1, beta, alpha)
- No time-based cadence
- No backward compatibility (always ship best current version)
- Quality is communicated through changelog, not version tags

### JSON Versioning (Claude's Recommendation)
Each JSON file should contain:
```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",  // Changes if structure changes
  "content_version": "1.0.0", // Matches release version
  "last_updated": "2025-08-15",
  "quality_metrics": {
    "total_items": 491,
    "documented": 165,
    "trust_green": 145,
    "trust_yellow": 15,
    "trust_red": 5
  }
}
```

### Version Documentation
- Include VERSION-STRATEGY.md in repo explaining our numbering
- Changelog shows quality improvements per version
- Each release lists what triggered it (new source, validation, etc.)

---

## 5. Trust Level System

### Three-Tier Confidence Marking
Every piece of information tagged with trust level:

#### ðŸŸ¢ Green - Verified (High Trust)
**Criteria for Green:**
- From Chip Gracey's documents AND fully self-consistent
- Document audit revealed no questions or conflicts
- Chip directly provided/confirmed the information
- All aspects of feature fully documented (no gaps)

**Example**: LUT memory is Green if we know:
- How it's shared between cog pairs
- All LUT instructions documented
- Procedures for using it
- Running code from it
- No remaining questions

#### ðŸŸ¡ Yellow - Uncertain (Medium Trust)
**Automatic Yellow when:**
- Conflicts between official sources
- Document incomplete, leaving questions
- Internal document contradictions
- Community sources (Ada's site, Q&A) awaiting Chip review
- Some information exists but can't be fully trusted

**Requires**: Identification of WHY it's yellow and WHICH sections conflict

#### ðŸ”´ Red - Missing (Low Trust/No Data)
**Red indicates:**
- Data is completely missing
- No documentation exists
- Feature mentioned but not explained
- Functionality assumed but not documented

### Feature-Level Trust
Apply trust at feature/subsystem level, not just instructions:

**Core Architecture:**
- **COG Operations**: Green/Yellow/Red for core COG functionality
- **Hub Memory**: Green/Yellow/Red for hub RAM access and sharing
- **LUT Memory**: Green/Yellow/Red for LUT RAM and cog-pair sharing
- **Hub Execution**: Green/Yellow/Red for hubexec mode
- **Egg-beater**: Green/Yellow/Red for hub slot timing

**Computation Systems:**
- **ALU Operations**: Green/Yellow/Red for arithmetic/logic
- **CORDIC Solver**: Green/Yellow/Red for all CORDIC operations
- **Multiply/Divide**: Green/Yellow/Red for hardware math
- **Pixel Mixer**: Green/Yellow/Red for pixel operations
- **Color Space Converter**: Green/Yellow/Red for color operations

**I/O Systems:**
- **Smart Pins**: Green/Yellow/Red per mode (32 modes total)
- **Streamer**: Green/Yellow/Red for DMA/streaming operations
- **DACs/ADCs**: Green/Yellow/Red for analog operations
- **Pin Groups**: Green/Yellow/Red for pin control operations

**Control Systems:**
- **Events System**: Green/Yellow/Red for event routing/handling
- **Interrupts**: Green/Yellow/Red for interrupt system
- **Branch/Jump**: Green/Yellow/Red for flow control
- **SKIP/EXECF**: Green/Yellow/Red for instruction skipping
- **REP Blocks**: Green/Yellow/Red for repeat functionality

**Memory Operations:**
- **FIFO/Block Transfers**: Green/Yellow/Red for SETQ/SETQ2 operations
- **PTR Operations**: Green/Yellow/Red for PTRA/PTRB usage
- **Register Indirection**: Green/Yellow/Red for ALT instructions
- **Stack Operations**: Green/Yellow/Red for PUSH/POP

**System Features:**
- **Boot Process**: Green/Yellow/Red for boot sequence
- **Clock/PLL**: Green/Yellow/Red for clock configuration
- **Debug System**: Green/Yellow/Red for debug features
- **Hub Locks**: Green/Yellow/Red for LOCK operations
- **Random Number**: Green/Yellow/Red for GETRND functionality

### Path to Green
**Only two paths to Green status:**
1. Chip's documentation + audit shows complete/consistent
2. Chip directly provides/confirms information

**Community validation** â†’ Flags for Chip review, not automatic Green
**Hardware testing** â†’ Supports Green but not sufficient alone

### Implementation in JSON
```json
{
  "instruction": "ADD",
  "trust_level": "green",
  "trust_reason": "Complete in P2 Doc v35, no conflicts",
  "source": "P2 Documentation v35, page 127",
  "subsystem": "ALU",
  "subsystem_trust": "green"
}
```

```json
{
  "feature": "LUT_memory",
  "trust_level": "yellow",
  "trust_reason": "Sharing mechanism between cogs unclear",
  "missing": ["exact pairing algorithm", "access arbitration"],
  "sources": ["P2 Doc v35 p.89", "Forum posts (unverified)"]
}
```

### Trust Warnings in Generated Code
- Include warnings only when behavior uncertain
- If code compiles and runs correctly, consider skipping warning
- Focus warnings on Yellow items that could behave unexpectedly
- Example: `// WARNING: Timing for QROTATE is estimated (yellow trust)`

---

## 6. Content Formats & Structure

### Single Format Strategy
**JSON Only** - Machine-readable for AI consumption
- No redundant markdown (humans have DeSilva guide, PASM2 manual)
- Developers can use JSON viewers/tools to explore
- Focus effort on quality JSON, not dual maintenance

### Directory Structure
```
/ai-reference/
  /v1.0/
    p2-complete-v1.0.json        # Everything in one file
    p2-instructions-v1.0.json   # Just instructions
    p2-architecture-v1.0.json   # Architecture only
    trust-report-v1.0.json      # Trust level summary (machine-readable)
    
    TRUST-CERTIFICATION-v1.0.md # Human-readable trust status
    README.md                    # Brief: what this is, how to use
    CHANGELOG.md                 # What changed this version
    GAPS.md                      # Known limitations
    SOURCES.md                   # Document sources & versions
    
  /latest/ -> v1.0/              # Symlink to current
  /schemas/
    p2-schema-v1.0.json         # JSON schema definition
```

### Trust Certification Document (Human Context)
**TRUST-CERTIFICATION-v1.0.md** - Answers key questions:
- What percentage of P2 knowledge is Green/Yellow/Red?
- Which subsystems are production-ready (Green)?
- Which features need validation (Yellow)?
- What's completely missing (Red)?
- What sources contributed to this version?
- What validation has occurred?
- Who reviewed/approved content?
- What's safe for production use?

**Impact Assessment Section**:
- **Code Generation Impact**: "Red trust issues do NOT block basic code generation"
- **What Works**: List features safe for AI code generation
- **What's Limited**: Features that will generate conservative/suboptimal code
- **What's Blocked**: Features that cannot be generated (if any)
- **Workarounds Available**: Alternative approaches for yellow/red features
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Green features: Full code generation confidence
  - Yellow features: Code will work but may not be optimal
  - Red features: AI will avoid or warn

**Example Impact Statement**:
"Despite 290 instructions lacking descriptions, AI can generate working P2 code using the 165 documented instructions. Missing instructions primarily affect optimization, not functionality."

**Purpose**: Helps users immediately understand if this version meets their code generation needs

### Additional Human Context Documents
**SOURCES.md** - Document provenance:
- List of all source documents with versions
- Extraction methodology used
- Date of extraction
- Known issues with each source

**These .md files**:
- Won't confuse AI scrapers (different extension)
- Provide critical context for humans
- Track quality/trust evolution
- Support decision-making about usage

### File Granularity (Claude's Preference)
- **p2-complete**: Everything for full context loading
- **p2-instructions**: When only instruction reference needed
- **p2-architecture**: When only architecture understanding needed
- **trust-report**: Quick trust level overview

### Trust Tracking in JSON
Each file includes trust metadata:
```json
{
  "trust_summary": {
    "last_audit": "2025-08-15",
    "green_features": ["ALU", "Smart_Pins_Mode_1-5"],
    "yellow_features": ["LUT_sharing", "CORDIC_timing"],
    "red_features": ["USB_mode", "Bytecode_format"],
    "instruction_trust": {
      "green": 145,
      "yellow": 15, 
      "red": 331
    }
  }
}
```

### What We DON'T Need
- Human-readable markdown mirrors of JSON
- Validation logs (trust levels handle this)
- Separate examples file (embedded in JSON)
- Per-instruction files (too granular)

---

## 7. JSON Schema Design (Claude-Optimized)

### Refined Schema Structure (No Redundancy)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/IronSheepProductionsLLC/P2-Knowledge-Base/schemas/p2-v1.0.json",
  "schema_version": "1.0",

  "metadata": {
    "generated": "2025-08-15T10:00:00Z",
    "trust_levels": {
      "green": "Verified from official docs, no conflicts, complete",
      "yellow": "Partial docs, conflicts exist, or awaiting verification",
      "red": "Missing documentation, functionality assumed"
    },

    }
  },
  
  "gaps": {
    "instructions_missing_descriptions": {
      "count": 290,
      "impact": "Can still generate code using 165 documented instructions",
      "workaround": "Use documented alternatives"
    },
    "timing_missing": {
      "count": 300,
      "impact": "Cannot optimize for speed",
      "workaround": "Use conservative timing estimates"
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **No Redundancy**: Instructions reference subsystem by name, not duplicated
2. **Trust Definitions**: Included in metadata so consumers understand
3. **Double-bounce Navigation**: Instruction â†’ subsystem name â†’ subsystem details
4. **Schema Versioning**: Separate from content version
5. **Standard $schema**: Points to our schema definition file
6. **Trust over Confidence**: Using red/yellow/green instead of percentages
7. **Impact Statements**: In gaps section and metadata

### Related Instructions Design Choice
**Just Names** (current choice):
- Pros: Smaller file, no redundancy, forces lookup
- Cons: Requires second lookup for details

**Full References** (alternative):
- Pros: Everything inline, no second lookup
- Cons: Massive redundancy, larger file

**Recommendation**: Keep as names only. AI can easily do the lookup, and it keeps the file clean.

- Legal company name confirmation
- Preferred attribution format
- Company description/tagline (if any)
- Professional letterhead template (if exists)

**Traditional Company Elements Needed:**
- How should we credit your company in documentation?
- Do you want a company website mentioned?
- Any specific legal notices required?
- Preferred contact method for professional docs?

### JSON Content Requirements (Claude's Specification)
**Must include both PASM2 AND Spin2:**

**PASM2 Coverage:**
- All 491 instructions (syntax + available descriptions)
- Subsystem categorization
- Trust levels per instruction
- Examples for documented instructions

**Spin2 Coverage:**
- Source file structure (CON/VAR/PUB/PRI/DAT/OBJ)
- Language constants and built-ins
- Operator precedence (when available)
- Control flow syntax (IF/CASE/REPEAT)
- Method definitions and calling conventions
- Inline assembly integration rules
- Memory model and variable types

### Quality Assurance Gates

#### Gate 1: Schema Validation
- All JSON files must validate against schema
- Automated validation as part of release process
- Schema changes require re-validation

#### Gate 2: Claude Consumption Test (Primary Gate)
**Claude must successfully demonstrate:**
1. **Loading**: Can parse and understand the JSON structure
2. **Code Generation**: Can generate working P2 code (both PASM2 and Spin2)
3. **Code Understanding**: Can analyze and explain existing P2 code
4. **Trust Awareness**: Appropriately handles yellow/red trust items
5. **Practical Usage**: Helps with real P2 development tasks

**Success Criteria**: "The proof is in the pudding" - if Claude can use it effectively for P2 development, v1.0 is ready.

### Future AI Release Planning
**Note for next AI release template:**
- Is it time to add missing artifacts? (example code, converters, etc.)
- Do we have multiple AI consumers with different needs?
- Are there community feedback mechanisms to tap into?

## 10. Git Strategy & Tagging

### Attribution Strategy
**Co-authoring**: Only when Chip directly contributes content (validates documents, provides corrections)
**General Thanks**: Include "Thanks to Parallax for sponsoring and supporting this effort" in release commits
**Contributors Section**: Maintain running list in README.md bottom section:
```markdown
## Contributors

### Content Contributors
- **Chip Gracey** - P2 architect, foundational documentation validation
- **[Community Member]** - [Nature of contribution]

### Production
- **IronSheep Productions LLC** - Documentation methodology and extraction
```

### Commit Message Strategy
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Release v1.0.0: First AI-optimized P2 knowledge release

- 165 of 491 PASM2 instructions documented (36% semantic coverage)
- All 32 Smart Pin modes documented
- Architecture 85% complete
- Trust level system implemented
- AI-optimized JSON schema design
- Ready for Claude Code consumption

Thanks to Parallax for sponsoring and supporting this effort.
Produced by IronSheep Productions LLC."
```

### Tagging Strategy
**Simple approach**: Lightweight tags only, no signing/GPG
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin main --tags
```

**Tag annotation** (if desired):
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "P2 Knowledge Base v1.0.0 - AI-ready release"
```

### Branch Strategy
**Current**: Work directly on main
**Rationale**: 
- Constantly improving documentation (no parallel development)
- Emergency patch capability preserved
- Simplicity until we have collaboration/PRs

**Future branching**: Only if million-dollar urgent fixes require it

### Parallax Handoff Strategy (Future)
**When Ken approves for official status**:
1. **Quality gate**: Ken declares "this is what the community needs"
2. **Commercial PDF production**: Full professional documentation
3. **Editorial review**: Ken approves company attribution, licensing, front/back matter
4. **Version tracking**: Keep history of all official Parallax handoffs
5. **Process documentation**: Record Ken's feedback for consistency

**TODO for future sprint**: 
- Schedule meeting with Ken to establish handoff process
- Document approved attribution format for official docs
- Define version tracking for commercial PDFs
- Establish editorial review workflow

### No Coordination Required
- Independent operation until official handoff
- Forum announcements notify community of new releases
- Ken monitors through repo access

## 11. Success Criteria

### Release Gates (ALL Must Pass)

#### Gate 1: Claude Consumption Success
**Claude must demonstrate all three capabilities:**

1. **Code Generation Test**: Generate working P2 code
   - **Spin2 only**: 10-15 method calls, uses DEBUG for serial output
   - **Spin2 + inline PASM**: 10-15 PASM instructions embedded in Spin2
   - **PASM only**: 10-15 PASM instructions, standalone program
   - **Success criteria**: Code compiles and produces expected serial output

2. **Code Understanding Test**: Analyze existing P2 code
   - **Parse Spin2 bytecode**: Identify opcodes from running interpreter
   - **Document functionality**: Explain what code sections do
   - **Build reference table**: "Version X has these bytecodes with these parameters"
   - **Success criteria**: Accurate analysis of known working code

3. **Schema Utilization**: Effectively use JSON structure
   - **Navigate efficiently**: Find relevant instructions/features quickly
   - **Trust awareness**: Appropriately handle green/yellow/red items
   - **Cross-reference**: Use related instructions and patterns
   - **Success criteria**: JSON enables rather than hinders Claude's work

#### Gate 2: Technical Validation
- [ ] All JSON files validate against schema
- [ ] Schema accurately describes all content (keep in sync)
- [ ] Both PASM2 and Spin2 coverage included
- [ ] Trust levels applied consistently
- [ ] File sizes reasonable for AI consumption

#### Gate 3: Professional Deliverables
- [ ] README updated with progress bars and release banner
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with v1.0.0 entry
- [ ] Professional PDFs generated (executive + detailed)
- [ ] Trust certification document complete
- [ ] Version strategy documented
- [ ] Contributors section added to README

#### Gate 4: Marketing Materials Ready
- [ ] Ken/Chip email updated with V2 findings
- [ ] Forum announcement crafted and ready
- [ ] Git tag and commit messages prepared
- [ ] All documents reflect current metrics

### Success Philosophy
**v1.0 Standard**: "Marginally useful proof of concept"
- Rich data with trust transparency
- Successfully generates working code
- Successfully interprets existing code
- Community can see meaningful progress
- Foundation for future improvements

**Future Standard** (eventual):
- Generate code using all instruction categories
- Handle all condition codes and flag operations
- Cover all P2 subsystems comprehensively
- 100% certified complete feature coverage

### No Rollback Strategy
**Forward-only releases**: Each version improves on the last
- If criteria met â†’ publish immediately
- If criteria missed â†’ fix and try again
- Quality improvements trigger new releases
- Never roll back, only improve

### Release Approval
**Final approval**: Stephen and Claude together watch Claude demonstrate successful code generation and understanding
- **If successful**: Publish immediately
- **If issues found**: Address issues and retest
- **Success measure**: "Was it really useful?"

## 12. Post-Sprint Deliverables

### Schema Authority & Automation Setup
**Schema Registry Approach:**
```
/schemas/
  /registry.json              # Master list with joint authority
  /latest -> p2-v1.0.json     # Always current version
  /p2-v1.0.json               # Versioned schemas
  /migration-guides/          # Schema evolution help
```

**Authority Attribution (Default, Ken to review):**
- Joint authority: "IronSheep Productions LLC & Parallax Inc."
- P2 copyright: "Propeller 2 processor and documentation Â© Parallax Inc."
- Architecture credit: "P2 architecture by Chip Gracey, Parallax Inc."

**Release Automation:**
- GitHub Actions for schema validation on every push
- Local release script for comprehensive gate testing
- Manual Claude consumption testing (guided by script)
- Schema versioning with backward compatibility

### Ken Review Integration
**Pre-release checklist includes:**
- "Here's how we attributed Parallax - any changes needed?"
- Quick text revision cycle before final release
- Ken provides exact corporate attribution preferences

### Tangible Outputs
1. **Published v1.0 release** in `/ai-reference/v1.0/` with all JSON/MD files
2. **Schema registry** with versioning and authority documentation
3. **Professional PDF proposal package** sent to Ken/Chip (updated with V2 findings)
4. **Updated README** with progress bars, trust metrics, and contributors section
5. **Git tag v1.0.0** preserving exact release state
6. **Forum announcement** crafted and ready for Phase 2
7. **Video demo script** for 3-week presentation preparation
8. **Release automation** (GitHub Actions + local validation script)
9. **Trust certification document** explaining production-readiness

### Knowledge Outputs
- **Claude consumption process** documented and tested
- **Schema authority approach** established with joint attribution
- **Release gate methodology** proven effective
- **Professional PDF workflow** from markdown â†’ Pages â†’ PDF
