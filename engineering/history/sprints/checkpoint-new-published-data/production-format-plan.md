**Subject**: "Ken - You Were Right About P2 Documentation (Proposal Attached)"

**Body** (brief):
```
Ken, Chip,

I've discovered something important while working on P2 documentation: 
Ken, you were absolutely right to stop funding it.

The attached proposal explains why - and shows how we can solve it differently.

Key points:
• Only 45% of P2 knowledge was documented (impossible to estimate)
• We can ship useful documentation incrementally (starting this week)
• Each release enables new market opportunities

The executive summary is 2 pages. The full proposal has details.

I'd love to discuss how your sponsorship can enable what was previously impossible.

Best regards,
Stephen
IronSheep Productions LLC

In collaboration with Chip Gracey

- Version controlled
- Quick updates

### Option 2: Design Tool (Polished)
- InDesign/Affinity Publisher
- More control over layout
- Professional polish
- Export to PDF

### Option 3: Hybrid

## Credits and Recognition Strategy

### Prominent Credits Throughout:
- **Cover/Header**: "Chip Gracey - P2 Architect & Technical Advisor"
- **Acknowledgments Section**: "Special thanks to Chip Gracey for his invaluable technical guidance and rapid response to architectural questions"
- **Technical Sections**: "Validated by Chip Gracey" stamps where appropriate
- **Future Vision**: "With continued collaboration from Chip Gracey..."

### Why This Matters:
1. **Makes Chip feel valued** - He's not just answering questions, he's a collaborator
2. **Builds his investment** - Credit creates ownership feeling
3. **Shows partnership** - Not extracting from him, working with him
4. **Professional credibility** - His name carries weight in P2 community
5. **Encourages participation** - Recognition motivates continued support

## Why This Format Works

**For Ken (CEO)**:
- Looks like other business proposals he reviews
- Easy to share with board/advisors
- Professional validation of his decision
- Clear ROI story
- Shows Chip is on board (huge validation)

**For Chip (Technical)**:
- Sees his name prominently credited
- Feels like collaborator, not resource
- Respects his time (2-page option)
- Technical appendix available
- Specific examples

- Recognition for his contributions

**For You (Stephen)**:

- Reusable for future sponsors
- Portfolio piece

## Next Steps

This format says: "This is a serious business proposition from a professional who understands both the technical and business challenges."
