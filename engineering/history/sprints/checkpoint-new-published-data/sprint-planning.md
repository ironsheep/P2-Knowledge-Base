# Sprint: Checkpoint - New Published Data (Reusable)

## Sprint Overview
**Type**: Reusable Marketing & Publishing Sprint  
**Trigger**: Whenever new valuable content is ready for release  
**Duration**: ~3 hours first time, ~1.5 hours for subsequent uses  
**Purpose**: Systematically publish, version, and market new P2 knowledge base content

## Current Release Context (v1.0)

## Sprint Phases

### Phase 1: Planning & Question Exhaustion (Current Phase)
**Goal**: Mutual agreement on exactly what we're publishing and how

**Key Decisions Needed**:

1. **Versioning Scheme**
   - Semantic versioning: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
   - v1.0.0 = First complete PASM2 instruction set
   - Tags: v1.0.0-ai-knowledge, v1.0.0-pasm2-complete
   - Branch strategy: main only, tags for releases

2. **Release Artifacts**
   - `/ai-reference/v1.0/` - Version-specific directory
   - `/ai-reference/latest/` - Symlink to current version
   - `/releases/v1.0-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Detailed release notes
   - `.ai-manifest.json` - Updated with version metadata
   - Git tag for exact commit state

3. **Content Formats**
   - JSON: Machine-readable, structured for AI consumption
   - Markdown: Human-readable documentation
   - Archive: ZIP of version directory for download

4. **README Marketing Structure**
   ```markdown

### Phase 2: Task Generation
**Goal**: Comprehensive task list covering all aspects of the release

### Phase 3: Execution
**Goal**: Generate content, create release, update marketing

## Questions for Mutual Agreement

### Content Questions
1. Should v1.0 include partial Smart Pins (10 modes) or wait for complete?
   - **Recommendation**: Include with clear "partial" labeling
   
2. Include confidence levels per instruction/feature?
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, three levels: verified, cross-referenced, inferred
   
3. How to handle "inferred" vs "explicit" documentation?
   - **Recommendation**: Tag each item with source type
   
4. Should we generate both JSON and Markdown, or JSON only with MD for humans?
   - **Recommendation**: Both - JSON for machines, MD for humans

### Process Questions
1. Do we create a GitHub Release or just tag?
   - **Recommendation**: Tag only for now, GitHub Release when public
   
2. Should we automate any part of this process?
   - **Recommendation**: Manual for v1.0, identify automation opportunities
   
3. How do we handle rollback if issues found?
   - **Recommendation**: Keep previous version directories, update symlink
   
4. Do we want a "beta" period before marking stable?
   - **Recommendation**: No beta for internal, yes when public

### Marketing Questions
1. How prominent should version history be on README?
   - **Recommendation**: Current + previous + next preview only
   
2. Include comparison metrics (before/after coverage)?
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, shows progress dramatically
   
3. Should we maintain a CHANGELOG.md separately?
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, plus release notes per version
   
4. How to highlight "pace of development" effectively?
   - **Recommendation**: "X days since last release" counter

### Technical Questions
1. Use symlinks for `/latest/` or copy files?
   - **Recommendation**: Symlink for efficiency
   
2. Include minified JSON versions?
   - **Recommendation**: Not for v1.0, consider later
   
3. Generate TypeScript definitions from JSON?
   - **Recommendation**: Not for v1.0, great v2.0 feature
   
4. Create example consumption code?
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, simple Python/JS examples

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Version-specific content directory created
- [ ] Release notes capture value clearly
- [ ] README markets the achievement effectively
- [ ] Git tag preserves exact state
- [ ] All audiences understand the value
- [ ] Clear path to next release visible
- [ ] Reusable process documented

## Post-Sprint Deliverables
1. Released v1.0 content in `/ai-reference/v1.0/`
2. Updated README with marketing message
3. Release notes in `/releases/`
4. Git tag v1.0.0
5. Updated .ai-manifest.json
6. This sprint process as reusable template

## Reusability Factors
This sprint template can be reused whenever:
- New document completed (PASM2 Manual, deSilva Guide)
- Major knowledge milestone reached
- Significant pattern library additions
- New source documents processed
- Architecture documentation expanded

The process remains the same, only the content and messaging change.
