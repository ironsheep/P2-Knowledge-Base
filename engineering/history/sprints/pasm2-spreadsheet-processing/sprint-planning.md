# PASM2 Spreadsheet Processing Sprint - Planning Document

**Sprint Planned**: Early August 2025  
**Planning Approach**: Start small, work larger - begin with tight, concise source
**Strategic Reasoning**: PASM2 spreadsheet chosen as starting point for systematic approach

---

## PLANNED OBJECTIVES

### Primary Goal:
**Establish systematic source processing methodology** using PASM2 instruction spreadsheet as proof of concept

### Why This Sprint First:
- **Start Small Strategy**: Spreadsheet = tight, concise information set
- **Foundation Building**: PASM2 instructions are lowest-level P2 programming foundation
- **Methodology Development**: Develop auditing approach on manageable source
- **Quality Validation**: Establish what "complete processing" means

---

## PLANNED APPROACH

### Source Processing Plan:
1. **Extract Complete Instruction Set**: All 491 instructions with metadata
2. **Categorize by Function**: Math, Logic, Memory, Control, etc.
3. **Identify Timing Information**: Clock cycles and execution characteristics  
4. **Document Encoding**: Instruction format and parameter details

### Quality Validation Plan:
1. **Conflicts Audit**: Check for internal contradictions
2. **Missing Information Audit**: Identify gaps needing designer input
3. **Cross-Reference Preparation**: Ready for integration with other sources

## PLANNED DELIVERABLES

### Primary Outputs:
- **Complete PASM2 instruction database** with all 491 instructions
- **Functional categorization** of instruction types  
- **Gap analysis** identifying missing technical details
- **Question inventory** for designer clarification

### Quality Artifacts:
- **Processing methodology** validated on real source
- **Audit procedures** established for future sources
- **Integration framework** ready for cross-referencing

- All instructions extracted and categorized
- No apparent contradictions within source
- Clear identification of information gaps
- Ready for cross-reference with silicon documentation

### Quality Indicators:
- Systematic audit methodology validated
- Question categorization process established  
- Foundation ready for document generation
