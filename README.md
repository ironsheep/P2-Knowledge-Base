## About the Propeller 2

The Propeller 2 (P2X8C4M64P) is a symmetric multicore microcontroller featuring **8 identical 32-bit processors** (COGs) that execute independently while sharing resources. Unlike traditional microcontrollers, the P2 provides true parallel processing with deterministic timing, making it ideal for real-time applications.

### Core Architecture
- **8 Independent COGs**: 90 MIPS each (720 MIPS total @ 180 MHz), true parallel execution
- **Dual Memory Model**: Each COG has 4KB private RAM; all share 512KB Hub RAM
- **Execute from Anywhere**: COGs can run code from COG RAM, LUT RAM, or Hub RAM
- **No Resource Contention**: Each COG has dedicated registers, no cache misses or pipeline stalls

### Smart Pin System  
- **64 Autonomous I/O Pins**: Each pin independently handles complex operations
- **Built-in Protocols**: UART, SPI, I²C, USB, quadrature decoding without CPU overhead
- **Analog & Digital**: 14-bit ADC, 16-bit DAC, PWM, and video generation per pin
- **Offload Everything**: Smart Pins run autonomously, freeing COGs for application logic

### Developer Advantages
- **Deterministic Timing**: Count cycles exactly, no interrupt latency
- **Hardware Parallelism**: No RTOS needed - hardware handles multiprocessing
- **CORDIC Math Engine**: Hardware multiply, divide, trig, and logarithms
- **Mixed Languages**: Spin2 (high-level), PASM2 (assembly), C/C++, Python
