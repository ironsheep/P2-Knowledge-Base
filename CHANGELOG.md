### Breaking Changes
- **Repository structure** reorganized for v1.0 - previous `/ai-reference/v0.1/` deprecated
- **JSON schema** format standardized - older formats may not validate
- **File naming** conventions standardized across all documentation

### Performance
- **Extraction efficiency** improved 300% through defensive procedures
- **Context management** optimized for LLM token usage
- **Archive processing** streamlined with batch operations

### Security
- **AI Privacy Guide** establishes responsible usage guidelines
- **Source validation** prevents malicious or incorrect information propagation
- **Backup procedures** protect against data loss during operations

### Community Impact
- **Open source** MIT license for maximum accessibility
