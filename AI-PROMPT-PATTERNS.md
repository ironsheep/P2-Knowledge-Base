Is the [INSTRUCTION/METHOD] documentation enriched?
Check if it has description, examples, and encoding details
in the YAML file.
```

### Find Code Patterns
```
Show me real-world patterns for [TECHNIQUE].
Search in external-projects/*/spin2-patterns-*.md
for proven implementations.
```

### Validate Generated Code

I need a real-time P2 application with:
- [LIST REQUIREMENTS]

Using the P2's deterministic timing and multi-COG architecture,
design the system referencing patterns from the knowledge base.
```

### Protocol Implementation
```
Implement [PROTOCOL] on P2.
Use Smart Pins where applicable (check modes/)
and PASM2 for timing-critical sections.
Reference any similar implementations in external-projects/.
```

## ‚ö° Quick Lookups

### Get All Instructions in a Category
```
List all P2 [CATEGORY] instructions with brief descriptions.
